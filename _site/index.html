            <strong>What drives the quality of local public goods in Africa? Disentangling social capital and ethnic divisions.</strong><br>
            <!--SPEAKER-->

                <!--ABSTRACT--> <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle(" Two important lines of research shaped our understanding of the ability of communities to engage in collective action. The first line proposes ethnic division as a key determinant, with more ethnically heterogeneous countries having lower economic performances and levels of public goods. Thus, we expect to find better schools where ethnic fractionalization is low. The second line of research focuses on social capital as a major determinant of the ability to engage in collective action.We expect that trust among community members, a widely-used measure of social capital, is an important and positive determinant of school quality. The present work aims to disentangle the relative effects of ethnic fractionalization and social capital on school quality. We use instrumental variable estimations to address reverse causality and other endogeneity issues. We instrument both social capital and ethnic fractionalization by using historical information on the settlement patterns of ethnic groups in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our empirical strategy is implemented by combining four datasets, including Afrobarometer, covering 16 Sub-Saharan countries. We run our analysis at the district level, with more than 1000 districts covered. We find an important and positive effect of trust on the practical aspects of schooling, such as maintaining buildings or providing textbooks. A one percent increase in the level of trust increases the quality of local public goods by 0.18 to 1.05 percent, depending on the measure of school quality under consideration. In sharp contrast, ethnic fractionalization is found to have a very limited effect, if any. We propose a simple model of public good provision that explores a channel by which social capital and ethnic division may (or may not) have an impact on the provision of local public goods such as schools. Our results suggest that policies designed to enhance social capital are likely to have a positive effect on schools and local public goods in general.</br>This is a joint work with Omar Sene.", 1))</script>

        <strong>Extending spacecraft operational life: Challenges and opportunities for control.</strong><br>

            <!--ABSTRACT--> <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("To extend spacecraft operational life, control techniques that can accommodate actuator failures, reduce the use of fuel and avoid collisions with debris are of interest. Such techniques may need to exploit 'higher order' physical effects, such as forces and torques normally considered as disturbances, approaches that can take advantage of nonlinearities in spacecraft kinematics and dynamics, and handle stationary and moving obstacle avoidance requirements. Hence spacecraft operational life extension problems create many potential opportunities for the application of nonlinear, optimal and constrained/predictive control.</br>After general remarks on control challenges and opportunities in spacecraft operational life extension problems, the presentation will focus on related recent case studies. </br>In particular, it will be shown that for a spacecraft with only two functioning reaction wheels linear controllability of attitude dynamics can be regained, under appropriate assumptions, if solar radiation pressure torques are included in the analysis. This conclusion can be exploited for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional linear controllers.  Alternative approaches that do not rely on the solar radiation pressure torques but exploit nonlinearities in the spacecraft kinematics and dynamics will also be discussed. Furthermore, an intriguing capability of model predictive controllers to achieve discontinuous stabilization in underactuated spacecraft attitude control problems will be highlighted. We will also touch upon coupled translational and rotational relative motion dynamics of a rigid spacecraft in central gravity field and potential opportunities to move translationally in space by employing attitude control only.  In the final part of the presentation, drift counteraction optimal control problems for systems with drift and/or large disturbances will be introduced, in which the objective is to maximize the time for a system to violate prescribed constraints. Potential applications of drift counteraction optimal control, including for geostationary satellite orbit maintenance and drag induced orbit decay compensation, will be discussed", 3))</script>
