In this presentation, I will talk about stability analysis of a particular class of hybrid systems, called switched linear systems, which consist of a finite set of linear dynamics (called modes) and a switching rule that indicates the current active mode of the system. Identification of such systems is often challenging due to hybrid behaviors, except for small systems with a small number of modes. To deal with this challenge, we propose data-driven methods in which we do not require a dynamical model. Instead, our methods only rely on a finite set of observations of system trajectories. To formally evaluate our methods, probabilistic guarantees are derived in the spirit of the scenario approach.", 0))</script>

However, in the multi-shape case (which is common due to polymorphism), additional information is required to recover the CLD from the PSD. We propose to combine the CLD measurement with an evolution model of the PSD (a transport equation) and to use an infinite-dimensional Luenberger observer.</br>More precisely, we apply the Back and Forth Nudging algorithm, based on forward and backward iterations of asymptotic observers on a finite time interval. We investigate in a more general framework the convergence properties of this algorithm, and derive observability conditions for the weak or strong convergence.

We develop a method to solve this stochastic control problem with a decentralized architecture, in order to respect privacy of individual users and to reduce both the telecommuni- cations and the computational burden compared to the setting of an omniscient central planner. This paradigm is called federated learning in the machine learning community, therefore we refer to this problem as a federated stochastic control problem. The optimality conditions are expressed in the form of a high-dimensional Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which is decomposed into smaller FBSDEs modeling the optimal behaviors of the aggregate population of TCLs of individual agents. In particular, we show that these FBSDEs fully characterize the Nash equilibrium of a stochastic Stackelberg differential game. In this game, a coor- dinator (the leader) aims at controlling the aggregate behavior of the population, by sending appropriate signals, and agents (the followers) respond to this signal by optimizing their storage system locally. A mean-field-type approxi- mation is proposed to circumvent telecommunication constraints and privacy issues. Convergence results and error bounds are obtained for this approximation depending on the size of the population of TCLs. A numerical illustration is provided to show the interest of the control scheme and to exhibit the convergence of the approximation. An implementation which answers practical industrial challenges to deploy such a scheme is presented and discussed.</br>Joint work with M. Grangereau.", 5))</script>

While remaining geometrically exact, the approach provides us with a minimal set of ordinary differential equations in the usual Lagrange matrix form that can be exploited for analysis and control design. Inspired from rigid robotics, the calculation of the matrices of this Lagrangian model is performed with a new reduced inverse Newton-Euler algorithm. To assess the approach, this Lagrangian model is compared against a well validated finite elements method through several benches of non-linear structural statics and dynamics, as well as applied to the control of a simplified multi-segment continuum arm.", 6))</script>

While model-less approaches (i.e., machine learning techniques) may neglect an explicit knowledge of the laws behind the system under study, the implementation of advanced control strategies (i.e., optimal or robust control) requires more effort with respect to model-based approaches, which, conversely, need a reliable and identifiable mathematical model.</br>Having the symbolic structure of the model representing the considered system, a crucial process consists in the identification of the intrinsic model parameters for the actual observed system, in order to have algebraic or differential equations able to reliably describe the process under study.</br>In robotics, a dynamic model is the relationship between joint motion (positions, velocities and accelerations) and applied joint torques. The knowledge of accurate dynamic models is of fundamental importance for many robotic applications, such as for planning minimum energy trajectories, when regulating force or imposing a desired impedance control at the contact, or when implementing strategies for the sensorless detection and isolation of unexpected collisions. By means of a dynamic observer of the unknown actuation faults (a.k.a. the residual vector), it is possible to retrieve an estimation of the external disturbances, thus unforeseen collisions. Furthermore, when a collision is sensed, possible countermeasures may be taken, as reaction maneuvers like human reflexes. Moreover, human-robot collaboration strategies in industrial settings are also achieved by means of the residual vector: for instance, the orientation of a workpiece held by the end-effector of a manipulator can be changed by simply pushing or pulling the robot structure, while preserving its position. </br> Beyond robotics, parameters identification is a critical issue even in biomedical contexts: for instance, the tuning of artificial pancreas devices for insulin-resistant patients. A recently published mathematical model accurately describing human glucose homeostasis is exploited to generate virtual patients: in particular, the glycemic profile of a healthy patient, together with the identified insulin-resistant patient parameters, can be successfully used to tune an external controller infusing insulin by subcutaneous injections.", 13))</script>

These systems are the source of complex control and engineering problems (mostly due to the transport phenomena and the presence of destabilizing terms), which have impact in terms of environmental safety and economic feasibility. In this presentation, we develop operating methods for the control of such hyperbolic systems. More precisely, using a backstepping approach combined with a rewrite of the system as a difference equation, we design an explicit control law (and the corresponding dual observer) that guarantees the robust output feedback stabilization of a system of two hyperbolic PDEs.  The proposed control law  introduces three degrees of freedom (by means of tuning parameters) that enable a trade-off between performance and robustness, between disturbance rejection and sensitivity to noise. The proposed approach can be extended to higher dimensional systems and networks interconnected systems. Finally, we conclude this presentation by considering the problem of toolface control for directional drilling operations with the bit off-bottom. The torsional dynamics of such a system can be modeled as a non-linear hyperbolic system for which a robust backstepping-based state-observer is  designed to monitor at all times the torque and the RPM. Using these estimations, we design an algorithm that controls the toolface orientation. The different algorithms are tested against real field data.", 14))</script>

In this talk we will focus on the use of the infinite-dimensional backstepping method to simplify coupling structures in systems of hyperbolic PDEs, allowing for constructive control designs that do not require the use of 'one actuator per transport equation,' thus reducing the need for over-actuated systems. The focus will be on results showing how the method extends to cases where ODE dynamics are present on the actuated and/or unactuated boundaries of hyperbolic systems. Particular attention will be paid to the robustness of such designs, which can require an 'infinite bandwidth' in their more naive forms, with respect to small delays in the control loop. A more practical control design will be presented, using adequately designed filters to restrict the bandwidth of the resulting controller while preserving the stability of the closed-loop system.", 15))</script>

One of the major difficulties in the design of neural networks lies in the fact that, to obtain networks with better performance, one needs to cascade more and more layers to make them deeper. Nonetheless, from an optimization viewpoint, this deeper structure gives rise to highly non-convex objects and makes the optimization dynamics seemingly intractable. In this work, we reformulate the well-known belief that linear neural networks have poor performances for nowadays challenge as an (almost sure) convergence to global minima. Besides partial results we prove the conjecture in the single-hidden-layer case. The proof relies on a precise characterization of the basin of attraction of all saddle points and is envisioned to generalize to more elaborate settings.

These dynamics are also motivated by multi-agent coordination protocols which are robust with respect to the additional input part. We will present such a cooperative control framework, which guarantees that network connectivity is robustly maintained with respect to bounded additive inputs. Furthermore, a modification of the feedback design ensures forward invariance of the agents' trajectories inside a convex workspace, without affecting the inputs' robustness bounds. <br>In order to derive the agents' distributed symbolic models, we determine space-time discretizations which establish that each agent's abstraction has at least one outgoing transition from every discrete state. The symbolic model of each agent is based on the knowledge of its neighbors' discrete positions and the transitions are performed through hybrid control laws, which can drive the agent to its possible successor states. As an extension of these results we also consider a varying degree of decentralization and build each abstract model based on discrete information up to a tunable distance in the communication graph. Finally, we discuss the derivation of online  abstractions, by discretizing over approximations of the agents' reachable sets over a bounded time horizon. ", 34))</script>

                <!--ABSTRACT--> <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Unlike for linear systems, no systematic method exists for the design of observers for nonlinear systems. However, observer design may be more or less straightforward depending on the coordinates we choose to express the system dynamics. In particular, some specific structures, called normal forms, have been identified for allowing a direct and easier observer construction. It follows that a common way of addressing the problem consists in looking for a reversible change of coordinates transforming the expression of the system dynamics into one of those normal forms, design an observer in those coordinates, and finally deduce an estimate of the system state in the initial coordinates via inversion of the transformation. This talk gives contributions to each of those three steps. First, we show the interest of a new triangular normal form with continuous (non-Lipschitz) nonlinearities. Indeed, we have noticed that systems which are observable for any input but with an order of differential observability larger than the system dimension, may not be transformable into the standard Lipschitz triangular form, but rather into an only  continuous triangular form. In this case, the famous high gain observer no longer is sufficient, and we propose to use  homogeneous observers instead. Another canonical form of interest is the Hurwitz linear form which admits a trivial observer. The question of transforming a nonlinear system into such a form has only been addressed for autonomous systems with the so-called Lunberger or Kazantzis-Kravaris observers. This design consists in solving a PDE and we show here how it can be extended to time-varying/controlled systems. As for the inversion of the transformation, this step is far from trivial in practice, in particular when the domain and image spaces have different dimensions. When no explicit expression for a global inverse is available, numerical inversion usually relies on the resolution of a minimization problem with a heavy computational cost. That is why we have developed a method to avoid the explicit inversion of the transformation by bringing the observer dynamics (expressed in the canonical form coordinates) back into the initial system coordinates. This is done by dynamic extension, i.e. by adding some new coordinates to the system and transforming an injective immersion into a surjective diffeomorphism.", 36))</script>

In this talk, I will describe a message-passing distributed algorithm that concurrently computes the harmonic influence of all nodes and provide a convergence analysis for it. The algorithm converges asymptotically, under the only assumption of the interaction Laplacian being symmetric. However, the convergence value does not in general coincide with the harmonic influence: simulations show that when the network has a larger number of cycles, the algorithm becomes slower and less accurate, but nevertheless provides a useful approximation. Simulations also indicate that the symmetry condition is not necessary for convergence and that performance (both in terms of speed and asymptotical error) scales well in the number of nodes of the graph.", 38))</script>

Uniform semiglobal and practical stability of the closed-loop system is then established, where the adjustable parameter is the discount factor. Stronger stability properties are thereupon guaranteed by gradually strengthening the assumptions. Next, we show that the Lyapunov function used to prove stability is continuous under additional conditions, implying that stability has a certain amount of nominal robustness. The presented approach is ﬂexible and we show that robust stability can still be guaranteed when the sequence of inputs applied to the system is no longer optimal but near-optimal. We also analyse stability for cost functions in which the importance of the stage cost increases with time, opposite to discounting. Finally, we exploit stability to derive new relationships between the optimal value functions of the discounted and undiscounted problems, when the latter is well-deﬁned.<br>This is a joint work with Lucian Busoniu (TU Cluj, Romania), D.

McEneaney originally developed it to approximate the value function of optimal control problems, leading to the ``max-plus basis method''.  Recently, Ahmadi et al. developed an approximation method for Barabanov norms, relying also on the approximation by suprema of quadratic forms.  Related methods allow one to compute program invariants, represented as intersections or unions or ellipsoids.  In all these approaches, the solution of large scale linear matrix inequalities by semidefinite programming methods is the computational bottleneck. We will show that the recourse to semidefinite programming can be avoided by expressing invariant generation and value function approximation as fixed point problems in the space of positive semidefinite matrices.  These problems involve operators which may be thought of as the noncommutative analogues of dynamic programming operators.  These analogues obtained by ``tropicalizing'' the Kraus maps (completely positive trace preserving maps) which arise in quantum information, i.e., by considering multivalued suprema of positive semidefinite matrices rather than their sum.  This approach relies on several properties of the Löwner order and of non-linear Perron-Frobenius theory, of independent interest, which we will review: selection of minimal upper bounds, contraction of non-linear maps and non-linear flows with respect to several metrics on the cone of positive definite matrices (Thompson, Hilbert and Riemannian metric).

Despite all these achievements, and in order to make this a useful technology, a major scaling step is required towards many-qubit (quantum bit) protocols. The main obstacle here is the destruction of quantum coherence (called decoherence) due to the interaction of the quantum system with its environment. The next critical stage in the development of quantum information processing is most certainly the active quantum error correction (QEC). Through this stage one designs, possibly using many physical qubits, an encoded logical qubit which is protected against major decoherence channels and hence admits a significantly longer effective coherence time than a physical qubit.

A lot of well-known partial differential equations are homogeneous in a generalized sense, (e.g. heat, wave, Navier-Stocks, Saint-Venant, Korteweg-de Vries, fast diffusion equations).

This talk will provide a new perspective on randomized methods for solving chance-constrained programming problems based on samples of uncertain parameters, and presents a theoretical framework for sampled convex programming that encompasses analyses of constraint discarding approaches and sequential sampling approaches. We show that tight bounds on the confidence of the solution of a sampled problem meeting chance constraints apply if a randomized sample discarding strategy is employed. This suggests a solution methodology which is both computationally convenient, being based on the solutions of convex sampled optimization problems, and efficient, requiring the solution of smaller numbers of problems than existing constraint discarding and sequential methods.

By acting on it with an external magnetic field, the swimmer twists and moves through the surrounding fluid. After explaining some specific difficulties coming from the Low Reynolds number regime, I will explain how to model the problem thanks to a system of non-linear ODEs. By considering the external magnetic field as a control function, I will state a local partial controllability result around the equilibrium states. Then, I will propose a constructive method to find a magnetic field that allows the swimmer to move along a prescribed trajectory (tracking) in view of obtaining global partial controllability results. Finally, I will show some numerical simulations thats illustrates the practical difficulties of the tracking method due to the straight positions of the swimmer.

Such techniques may need to exploit 'higher order' physical effects, such as forces and torques normally considered as disturbances, approaches that can take advantage of nonlinearities in spacecraft kinematics and dynamics, and handle stationary and moving obstacle avoidance requirements. Hence spacecraft operational life extension problems create many potential opportunities for the application of nonlinear, optimal and constrained/predictive control.</br>After general remarks on control challenges and opportunities in spacecraft operational life extension problems, the presentation will focus on related recent case studies. </br>In particular, it will be shown that for a spacecraft with only two functioning reaction wheels linear controllability of attitude dynamics can be regained, under appropriate assumptions, if solar radiation pressure torques are included in the analysis. This conclusion can be exploited for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional linear controllers.  Alternative approaches that do not rely on the solar radiation pressure torques but exploit nonlinearities in the spacecraft kinematics and dynamics will also be discussed. Furthermore, an intriguing capability of model predictive controllers to achieve discontinuous stabilization in underactuated spacecraft attitude control problems will be highlighted. We will also touch upon coupled translational and rotational relative motion dynamics of a rigid spacecraft in central gravity field and potential opportunities to move translationally in space by employing attitude control only.  In the final part of the presentation, drift counteraction optimal control problems for systems with drift and/or large disturbances will be introduced, in which the objective is to maximize the time for a system to violate prescribed constraints. Potential applications of drift counteraction optimal control, including for geostationary satellite orbit maintenance and drag induced orbit decay compensation, will be discussed", 59))</script>
