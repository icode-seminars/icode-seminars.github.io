  <strong>Gaussian random fields on Riemannian manifolds: Sampling and error analysis</strong><br />
  <!--SPEAKER-->

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Many applications in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics require data to be modeled by Gaussian processes on non-Euclidean domains, or with non-stationary properties. Using such models generally comes at the price of a drastic increase in operational costs (computational and storage-wise), rendering them hard to apply to large datasets. In this talk, we propose a solution to this problem, which relies on the definition of a class of random fields on Riemannian manifolds. These fields extend ongoing work that has been done to leverage a characterization of the random fields classically used in Geostatistics as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations. The discretization of these generalized random fields, undertaken using a finite element approach, then provides an explicit characterization that is leveraged to solve the scalability problem. In this talk, we present how this approach is used to tackle the simulation and prediction of Gaussian fields on surfaces with given covariance properties (non-stationary and/or spatio-temporal), we present results on the strong error induced by the finite element approximations.​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Mike Pereira received the M.Sc. degree in engineering and his Ph.D. degree in Geostatistics and Applied probability from Mines Paris - PSL University, Paris, France, respectively 2016 and 2019.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Cross-device training is a crucial subfield of federated learning, where the number of clients can reach the billions. Standard approaches and local methods are prone to client drift and insensitivity to data similarities. We propose a novel algorithm (SPAM) for cross-device federated learning with non-convex and non-smooth losses. We provide a sharp analysis under second-order (Hessian) similarity, a condition satisfied by various machine learning problems in practice. Additionally, we extend our results to the partial participation setting, where a cohort of selected clients communicate with the server at each communication round. We then conduct a complexity analysis of our convergence results, showing the improvement of our methods upon prior work.​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;I am a Research Scientist at CNRS/L2S.

  <strong>​​​​LMI-based Suboptimal Consensus for a class of LTI Multi-agent Systems​</strong><br />
  <!--SPEAKER-->
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/avishimpu/home" target="_blank"><em>Avinash Kumar (L2S)</em></a>
<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("​​​​​Control design for multi-agent systems has gained utmost interest among theorists and practitioners in different forms of achieving application-dependent control objectives. One of the most important problems in the coordination control of multi-agent systems is the consensus protocol design problem, also known as the agreement problem. In this talk we shall discuss a new technique for suboptimal consensus protocol design for a class of multi-agent systems. The technique is based upon the linear matrix inequalities which at the first place were analyzed for the linear quadratic problems. For suboptimal consensus protocol design, the structural requirements on the overall feedback gain matrix, which are inherently imposed by agents dynamics and their interaction topology, are recast on a specific matrix introduced in a suitably formulated convex optimization problem. As a result, preassigning the identical feedback gain matrices to a network of homogeneous agents, which act on the relative state variables with respect to their neighbors is not required. We shall see how the suboptimality of the computed control laws can be quantified by implicitly deriving an upper bound on the cost in terms of the solution of a convex optimization problem and initial conditions of the agents instead of specifying it a priori.​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;​Avinash Kumar works as a postdoc researcher at L2S, CentraleSupelec with Professors William Pasillas-Lepine and Lucas Greco, trying to develop the techniques to control the air-flow in ventilation systems.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle(" Motivated by the increasing resolution of data, we address the problem of identifying low-dimensional autonomous systems observed via high-dimensional measurements. We do not assume prior knowledge of the latent dimension or its dynamics. However, we assume the measurements are obtained from the latent state via an injective map. As a consequence, the observations also follow an autonomous dynamical system. This observation builds our starting point for reducing the non-linear identification problem towards a (tractable) convex optimization problem. We discuss different obstacles that came across our route, several limiting factors, and situations for which our approach provides feasible solutions to the identification problem.

  <strong>Stabilization of Integral Delay Equations​​​​​</strong><br />

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("In this presentation, we address the stabilization of Integral Delay Equations (IDE), a class of Time-Delay Systems for which the value of the state at a given time depends on its past values on a fixed time-window horizon. IDEs play a fundamental role in modeling physical dynamics involving transport phenomena. Specifically, we consider first a system for which the control input is subject to pointwise and distributed input delays. The proposed stabilizing control law is expressed using integrals of the state and of the input itself over a constant time horizon with gains derived from solving a system of Fredholm-type equations. Additionally, we investigate the case where the control input only acts on the system in a distributed way. The proposed initial approach incorporates a non-necessary condition (which is illustrated through a counterexample), which we aim to eliminate.  Consequently, we propose an alternative approach trying to get rid of this condition. As part of the preparation for a doctoral thesis, we show how this analysis can be extended to the case of IDE systems with multiple state delays.​​​​​​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp; Adam Braun is PhD student at L2S ​​​under the supervision of Jean Auriol and Lucas Brivadis​", 6))</script></td>

  <strong>Un flot de gradient sur l'espace des contrôles avec condition initiale irrégulière​​​​​</strong><br />
  <!--SPEAKER-->

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle(" On considère un problème de contrôle consistant à trouver une trajectoire reliant un point initial x à un point cible y, le système se déplaçant uniquement dans certaines directions admissibles. On suppose que les champs de vecteurs correspondants satisfont la condition de Hörmander, de telle sorte que par un théorème classique (Chow-Rashevskii), il existe des trajectoires qui satisfont cette contrainC'te. Une manière naturelle d'essayer de résoudre ce problème est via un flot de gradient sur l'espace des contrôles. Cependant, la dynamique correspondante peut avoir des point-selles, et pour obtenir un résultat de convergence il faut donc faire des hypothèses (par exemple probabilistes) sur la condition initiale. Dans ce travail, nous considérons le cas où cette initialisation est irrégulière, que nous formulons grâce à la théorie des trajectoires rugueuses de Lyons. Dans des cas simples, on prouve que le flot de gradient converge vers une solution, si la condition initiale est une trajectoire d'un mouvement Brownien (ou d'un processus de régularité plus faible). La preuve combine des idées de calcul de Malliavin avec des inégalités de Łojasiewicz. Une motivation possible pour nos travaux vient de l'entraînement de réseaux de neurones résiduels profonds, dans un régime où le nombre de paramètres par couche est fixé, et la dimension du vecteur de données est élevée.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental constraints on system dynamics, which, in the linear realm, are manifested through the physical realizability conditions on system matrices. These restrictions give system matrices a unique structure. This paper aims to study this structure by investigating the zeros and poles of linear quantum systems. Firstly, it is shown that  -s_0 is a transmission zero if and only if  s_0 is a pole of the transfer function, and -s_0  is an invariant zero if and only if  s_0  is an eigenvalue of the  A-matrix, of a linear quantum system. Moreover,  s_0 is an output-decoupling zero if and only if -s_0 is an input-decoupling zero. Secondly, based on these zero-pole relations, it is proven that a linear quantum system must be Hurwitz unstable if it is strongly asymptotically left invertible. Stable input observers are constructed for unstable linear quantum systems. Finally, the sensitivity of a coherent feedback network is investigated. It is found that the well-known complementarity constraint between sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions no longer holds in the quantum regime; instead, much richer fundamental performance limitations exist. The  fundamental tradeoff between ideal input squeezing and system robustness is studied on the basis of system sensitivity analysis.​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Guofeng Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2005.

A reliable and high-resolution image of the subsurface structure allows us to reduce operational risks and increase production. To provide an accurate subsurface image with low uncertainties, the processing of recorded seismic data is necessary. The availability of big datasets and advanced computational resources dramatically changed the processing algorithms, and data analysis techniques all look different than they did five years ago. AI and machine learning gained remarkable attraction in the geophysical community. Also, the industry is building its energy transformation strategy for the next 10 to 30 years to efficiently and safely produce renewable energy resources.

This characteristic can be exploited to indirectly solve many control problems, such as output regulation or multi-agent synchronization.

We present sufficient conditions for the design of an incrementally stabilizing controller based on the solution of a nonlinear Modified Algebraic Riccati Inequality.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("We propose two methods to solve the master equation for finite-state mean field games (MFGs). Solving MFGs provides approximate Nash equilibria for stochastic, differential games with finite but large populations of agents. The master equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose solution characterizes MFG equilibria for any possible initial distribution. The first method we propose relies on backward induction while the second one directly tackles the PDE without discretizing time. For both approaches, we prove two types of results: there exist neural networks that make the loss functions of the algorithms arbitrarily small and, conversely, if the losses are small, then the neural networks are good approximations of the master equation solution. We conclude with numerical experiments on benchmark problems from the literature in dimension up to 15, and a comparison with solutions computed by a classical method for fixed initial distributions.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->

To enhance the real-time monitoring of voltage magnitudes of these LV grids, the distribution system state estimator could be a good solution to be deployed. Conventional techniques for state estimation have been deployed for transmission systems and medium voltage distribution systems. However, their application to LV grids is challenged by the unbalance of these grids and the limited access to real-time measurements. Indeed, even with the widespread deployment of smart meters, real-time access to their measurements is limited due to communications constraints.Nonetheless, the availability of historical data from smart meters opens new possibilities for machine learning techniques. However, the application of classical machine learning techniques for the state estimation task is limited by a lack of knowledge of the physical aspect of the electrical systems. This leads to a machine learning model specialized to perform only on the grid whose historical data were used for training. The objective of the thesis is to explore machine learning techniques for LV state estimation with a focus in proposing a hybrid LV approach that combines machine learning techniques with the physical aspects of the distribution systems, towards a physics-informed neural network based LV state estimator.​​​​​​​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Elio El Semaan is conducting his doctoral thesis on low voltage distribution system state estimation at EDF R&D, Group of electrical engineering Paris (GeePs) and Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S), under the supervision of Philippe Dessante, Trung Dung Le and Alessio Iovine.

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Modeling a dynamical system as a stochastic process allows for the propagation of uncertainty throughout time. Such stochasticity could originate in measurement errors, unknown environments, adverse dynamics (up to distributional assumptions), etc. This talk discusses methods to bound the risk of trajectories associated with this stochastic process over a finite time horizon. The output of such risk analysis could be used to compare and improve associated control laws. The three risk classes considered in this presentation are the probability of contacting the unsafe set, the maximum instantaneous value of a risk measure, and the maximum time-windowed value of a risk measure. In the context of a power system in which a distribution line is rated at 100 amps, the first risk class is the maximum probability that 100 amps will be reached by the stochastic process at some point in time. The second risk class could be the maximum mean or 90% CVaR of current along the line at any particular time. The third risk class would then be the maximum mean or 90% CVaR evaluated in any contiguous 5-minute time window (which is related to the heat dissipation capacity of the line). Each of these tasks will be solved by posing a primal-dual pair of infinite dimensional linear programs in occupation measures / continuous functions. The continuous function formulation of these risk measures have associations with prior work in stochastic barrier functions for safety and in value functions for stochastic control. Discretizations of these linear programs allow for the computation of a convergent sequence of upper-bounds to the true risk attained by stochastic trajectories. Challenges inherent in the control problems of minimizing these risk classes will also be discussed.​​​​​​​<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Jared Miller is a postdoctoral researcher at the Automatic Control Lab, ETH Zurich, in the research group of Prof. Roy S.

A number of methods have been proposed for approaching and capturing defunct satellites and other high-value debris, based on autonomous planning and control. In this talk, recent developments in providing robustness to this autonomous operational approach are presented. A significant portion of the objects to be captured are tumbling with unknown angular orientation and rate. As such, the rendezvous and capture procedure for these tumbling objects is complex and must be performed in real-time, precluding human teleoperation. A series of autonomous functionalities will first be presented for the autonomous rendezvous of the robotic spacecraft with the tumbling target, including state estimation of the target motion, as well as NLP-based motion planning and robust MPC control for tracking. The robust MPC control, which leverages a tube-based approach, provides robustness to the uncertainty in the target motion prediction. Following, a robust online motion re-planning methodology will be presented, which can be applied to parametric optimal control problems of relevance to the robot capture task. A fully autonomous rendezvous pipeline was recently demonstrated in microgravity on resource-constrained ASTROBEE hardware on the ISS. Preparations for a robotic capture demonstration mission are currently ongoing within the EROSS IOD Peraspera project of the EU Horizon 2020 Space Programme.

Is it possible that fishermen, when acting selfishly, each in his or her own best interest, might lead to a reversal of the travelling wave and, consequently, to an extinction of the global fishes' population? To answer this question, we model the behaviour of individual fishermen using a Mean Field Game approach, and we show that the answer is yes.

We establish that beyond certain coupling thresholds, inside each module, the systems synchronize rapidly with a weighted-average dynamical system that evolves more slowly than the individual systems. Then, the average dynamical systems corresponding to each and all the modules synchronize among themselves.

Dans un premier temps je présenterai des résultats généraux de stabilisation pour une large classe de systèmes linéaires contrôlables, obtenus par la méthode de backstepping. Celle-ci consiste à chercher un changement de variables inversible qui produit un système plus facile à stabiliser. L'introduction de ce problème auxiliaire permet alors d'obtenir des lois de rétroaction explicites en un sens qu'on illustrera sur quelques exemples.<br />Dans un second temps, j'exposerai des travaux tout récents sur l'utilisation d'une méthode de dualité pour approcher l'ensemble atteignable d'un système contrôlé lorsque le contrôle est soumis à des contraintes convexes. Prenant appui sur la dualité de Fenchel&ndash;Rockafellar, l'idée est d'introduire un problème auxiliaire, dit problème dual.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The topic of this talk is the stabilization of PDE or ODE systems. We will discuss three subjects: first, we will focus on the robustness of boundary controls for hyperbolic systems with respect to perturbations in the propagation speeds. We will show that for hyperbolic systems, even simple controls can be extraordinarily non-robust, particularly when they rely on an observer of the dynamic. Adding a small amount of viscosity can either aid in regaining stability or, on the contrary, destabilize the system. Next, we will focus on a practical application: the stabilization of traffic flow using autonomous vehicles as a means of control. Lastly, we will explore some applications of AI in mathematics, particularly in stabilization. We will discuss whether an AI can guess the solution of a problem and whether an AI can even independently prove a theorem.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Amaury Hayat earned his doctorate in 2019 under the supervision of Jean-Michel Coron at Sorbonne Université.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Bifurcation theory appears to be one of the most used mathematical tools to address neuroscience questions, mainly in describing (spontaneous) pattern formation in the primary visual cortex (V1) under a sudden qualitative change of some parameter. It remains a powerful tool in understanding sensory-driven and self-organised cortical activity interactions, mainly when the sensory input is fully distributed in V1, Nicks et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 2021). Nevertheless, in the presence of localised sensory inputs used, e.g., in the psychophysical experiments of Mackay (Nature, 1957) and Billock and Tsou (PNAS, 2007), techniques from bifurcation theory and even from multi-scale analysis seem ineffective for describing these phenomena.<br />In this talk we will present mathematical framework to explain these phenomena in V1, which consists of input-output controllability of an Amari-type neuronal fields model. In our discussion, the sensory input is interpreted as a cortical representation of the visual stimulus used in each experiment. It contains a localised distributed control function that models the stimulus's specificity, e.g., the redundant information in the centre of MacKay's funnel pattern (&ldquo;MacKay rays&rdquo;) or the fact that visual stimuli in Billock and Tsou's experiments are localized in the visual field. In particular, we will highlight the crucial role played by the non-linearity in these phenomena.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Dario Prandi was born in 1986 in Italy.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("In the realm of controlling complex robotic systems, it is a common practice to resort to layered cascade controllers. In this model each level of control closes a local loop to track the references given by the higher level controller and considers the lower level controller good enough to manage its own references.

In this presentation I show our attempts to close the loop over several layers and to use more rich models in order to keep compliance, robustness and dynamic control systems. Three examples are presented, the control of biped locomotion, the estimation of the state of a humanoid robot and the control of physical human robot interaction with compliance and safety constraints.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Mehdi Benallegue holds an engineering degree from the National Institute of Computer Science (INI) in Algeria, obtained in 2007.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Biological systems can be seen as dynamical networks, i.e. dynamical systems that are naturally endowed with an underlying network structure, because they are composed of several subsystems that interact according to an interconnection topology. Despite their large scale and complexity, they often exhibit an extraordinary robustness that preserves fundamental properties and qualitative behaviours even in the presence of huge parameter variations and environmental fluctuations.<br />We look for the source of the amazing robustness that often characterises biological systems, by identifying properties and emerging behaviours that exclusively depend on the system structure (the graph topology along with qualitative information), regardless of parameter values. We introduce the BDC-decomposition to capture the system structure and enable the parameter-free assessment of important properties, including the stability of equilibria and the sign of steady-state input-output influences, thus allowing structural model falsification and structural comparison of alternative mechanisms proposed to explain the same phenomenon.<br />Finally, we discuss the limitations of structural methodologies, which may be overcome by integrating and complementing them with probabilistic approaches.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Giulia Giordano is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Trento.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("How does a group of agents break indecision when deciding about options with qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multi-agent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group are at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state agents are not biased toward any specific option and therefore the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option and show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in opinion networks. Inspired by these model-independent results, we introduce a new nonlinear model of opinion dynamics over networks and illustrate its value for understanding flexible and tunable decision-making in a wide variety of contexts.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Alessio Franci got his Master 2 (Laurea Specialistica) Degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Pisa in 2008 and his PhD in Physics and Control Theory from the University of Paris Sud 11 in 2012.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("In this talk, an adaptive nonlinear droop-based control approach is proposed for converter-based self-contained electrical power systems (EPS) designed for electric aircraft applications to ensure tight voltage regulation and accurate load power distribution among parallel sources. By taking into account the accurate nonlinear dynamic models of the power converters, a mathematical proof of an upper bound is guaranteed for the input current of each converter separately, by means of Lyapunov methods and ultimate boundedness theory. In essence, the adopted nonlinear droop-based controller introduces a virtual voltage and a virtual resistance in series with the inductance and parasitic resistance of each DC/DC boost converter. To verify the proposed controller performance and the underlying developed approach, simulation results of the low-voltage bus dynamics have been carried out for an onboard aircraft DC microgrid.", 37))</script></td>

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Many control problems in the engineering domain can be abstracted as multi-input multi-output steady-state regulation problems, where the system needs to be steered to an efficient operating point that is compatible with the operating limits of the plant. We will see that controllers for this class of problems can be designed by tapping into the tools of nonlinear optimization, and in particular first-order and zeroth-order methods. Interconnecting an iterative algorithm with a physical system requires however some care in order to guarantee well-posedness of the resulting dynamical system and closed-loop stability. On the other hand, this design approach yields robust controllers that are (almost) model-free and successfully tackle this complex steady-state control problems even in the presence of substantial uncertainty on the plant and on the unknown disturbances.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Saverio Bolognani received the Ph.D degree in Information Engineering from the University of Padova, Italy, in 2011.

  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Space missions are extremely expensive, especially deep-space exploration ones. In recent years, the advent of CubeSats (i.e., miniaturized spacecraft) in Low Earth Orbit has drastically decreased spacecraft integration and development costs. However, the costs required to operate satellites do not scale with their dimension. Therefore, advantages brought by CubeSats could be partially jeopardized. With the recent success of CubeSats demonstration missions in deep-space and in the Earth-Moon environment, it becomes crucial to develop autonomous GNC systems for small satellites in order to further allow the use of miniaturized spacecraft in future exploration missions. If successful, these systems could be easily adapted to larger spacecraft with tremendous impact on their costs and therefore on the entire space sector.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The analysis of consensus formation is not a completely fresh topic, as its investigation started around the end of the 1990's in physics- and engineering-related research communities. In the beginning of the years 2000s, some general and rather sharp conditions ensuring the convergence to consensus for finite-dimensional multiagent systems had been put forth in several independent works.<br />More recently, a trend of mathematical research at the interface between the analysis of collective dynamics and kinetic theory focused on the generalisation of these stability results to various kinds of macroscopic approximations of multiagent systems, defined e.g. via the meanfield procedure. While being both meaningful and flexible, the latter only accounted for symmetric interaction topologies, and thus excluded a large number of asymmetric models which are relevant in applications. In order to paliate this intrinsic limitation, a couple of recent papers have started studying the question of consensus formation in <em>graphon dynamics</em>, which are inherently better-suited to handling asymmetric interactions.<br />In this talk, I will discuss two families of sufficient conditions ensuring the exponential convergence towards consensus for macroscopic approximations of first-order multiagent dynamics described by graphons, derived in collaboration with N.&nbsp;Pouradier Duteil and M.&nbsp;Sigalotti. These latter will involve suitable infinite-dimensional generalisations of the so-called <em>scrambling coefficient</em> and <em>algebraic connectivity</em> of the interaction topology, which are known to be intimately connected to the asymptotic behaviour of cooperative systems in the finite-dimensional setting.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Benoît Bonnet-Weill est chargé de recherche au LAAS-CNRS où il travaille sur les thématiques du transport optimal et du contrôle multi-agent depuis qu'il a rejoint le laboratoire en 2021.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Convex liftings (and their dual projection operations) emerged recently as an attractive framework to handle complex nonlinear decision problems. It has been investigated in the last ten years in relationship with inverse parametric linear/quadratic programming and then extended to several related topics. In the first studies, the aim was to construct an appropriate optimization problem composed of a set of linear constraints and a cost function such that the optimal solution to such a problem is equivalent to the given piecewise affine function defined over a polyhedral partition. The present talk introduces the constructive procedure established to address this problem. As a first geometrical result, an algorithm to construct convex liftings of a given convexly liftable cell complex will be put forward. Pursuing this idea, an important result will be presented: any continuous piecewise affine function defined over a polyhedral partition is the solution of a parametric linear/quadratic programming problem which can be numerically constructed. Furthermore, this convex lifting based method requires at most one supplementary dimension. This structural result has interesting connections to control design: in constrained linear model predictive control (MPC) where it can be shown that any continuous piecewise affine control law can be obtained via a reformulated linear MPC problem with the control horizon at most equal to two prediction steps; in the evaluation of PWA controllers through a fast positioning mechanism; in obstacle avoidance problems to generate feasible corridors for navigation.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Sorin Olaru is a Professor at CentraleSupélec in France where he holds the RTE Chair on &quot;The Digital Transformation of Electricity Networks&quot;.

  <strong>Comparison of the bit–torque models for estimating bit-rock interaction parameters in real-time using an adaptive observer</strong><br />

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Obtaining real-time estimates of the bit-rock interaction (BRI) parameters and real-time formation pose significant challenges in developing an automated closed-loop geo-steering system for drilling operations. A major challenge for the same is the prohibitively expensive high bit-rate and low latency downhole telemetry systems. Drilling dynamics can be broadly divided into off-bottom and on-bottom dynamics. Recent results have successfully captured the significant dynamics for off-bottom dynamics and have been validated against the field data [1]. However, developing an on-bottom dynamics field validated model is faced with significant challenges in accurately estimating the bit-rock interaction parameters, which in turn aid in estimating formation detection in real-time. A simulation-validated on-bottom dynamics model was recently proposed by Auriol et al. [2]. The model was developed based on the understanding of bit-rock interaction as proposed by Detournay and Defourny [3]. The BRI law, proposed by Detournay and Defourny, is dependent on friction coefficient at the rock contact, bit constant, depth of cut, intrinsic specific energy of the rock, drilling strength, and weight-on-bit (WOB). Auriol et al. [2] modified the BRI law by simplifying the model whose BRI parameters are dependent on WOB and depth of cut. The variations in the BRI parameters give insights into the happenings of drilling at the interface of the drillstring. However, this model doesn't give a direct insight into the changes in the rock strength. To address the same, a mechanical specific energy (MSE) based law is proposed to obtain the bit torque. The changes in the bit-torque obtained using the MSE-based approach give direct insights into the changes in the rock strength, which is helpful for formation change detection.<br /><br />The off-bottom dynamics field validated model is based on the distributed drillstring model and uses only the surface parameters, RPM, and torque. In the proposed work, the on-bottom dynamics model as proposed by Auriol et al. and the MSE-based bit-torque models are combined with the field-validated off-bottom dynamics model. Coupled with the surface RPM and surface torque, the proposed model uses additional surface measurements, weight-on-bit, differential pressure, and flow rate to estimate the downhole RPM, downhole torque, and the BRI parameters. In proposed model assumes the torsional motion of the drill string to be the dominating dynamics behavior, a constant rate-of-penetration (ROP) and therefore a steady axial velocity of the bit, no distributed axial dynamics, and the friction coefficients along the drillstring are known. The proposed models are field validated against the field data obtained for an unconventional well drilled in North America.<br /><br />The soft sensor developed in this work is the extension of the same developed for the off-bottom dynamics field validated model that provides estimates for downhole torque and the BRI parameters along with the downhole RPM by using only the surface measurements. Once the bit tags the bottom, the estimation of the friction coefficients is stopped, and the BRI parameters and the downhole torque are estimated. The main reason behind adopting such an approach is that the observer used in the model cannot distinguish between friction coefficients and the bit-rock interaction parameters. By using such an approach, the friction coefficients and the BRI parameters are estimated separately, without the need for any further complex mathematical model. The estimates provided by the proposed soft sensor were found to be robust to poor initial estimates. The vital feature of the observer is its ability of adaptive estimation. Convergence of the friction parameters is aided by the adaptive estimation nature of the soft sensor, which otherwise is computationally expensive using other techniques that include the industry-standard friction tests where the pipe is raised and then lowered. The model used in this work is computationally efficient, which is a result of its simplistic nature. This makes the proposed model an appealing candidate for online, real-time sensing systems for drilling applications.<br /><br /><em>Keywords:</em> Bit-rock interaction (BRI), depth-of-cut, weight-on-bit, observer estimation<br /><br /><em>References:</em><br />[1] S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Kandala, and R.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Shor, &ldquo;Evolution of static and kinetic friction in a horizontal well using an adaptive model-based observer: Field validation,&rdquo; Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, vol. 208, part D, 2022.<br />[2] J.&nbsp;Auriol, U.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Aarsnes, and R.&nbsp;Shor, &ldquo;Self-tuning torsional drilling model for real-time Applications,&rdquo; ACC 2020.<br />[3] E.&nbsp;Detournay and P.&nbsp;Defourny, &ldquo;A phenomenological model for the drilling action of drag Bits,&rdquo; International journal of rock mechanics and mining sciences & geomechanics abstracts, vol. 29, pp. 13–23, 1992.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Shanti Swaroop Kandala received a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, in 2020.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->

Anyhow, thanks to the homogeneity property, we provide local/practical stability results.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Matteo Della Rossa obtained a master degree in Mathematics (cum laude) from University of Udine (Italy), in 2017.

For example, a robot assisting astronauts in space should be able to autonomously identify its coupled dynamics with uncertain payloads while always avoiding collisions with obstacles. In this talk, I will present a data-driven approach for safely performing tasks under dynamics uncertainty. The algorithm tackles chance-constrained problems that are initially infeasible due to high dynamics uncertainty by autonomously exploring and learning online to reduce uncertainty before performing the task. Then, I will discuss the problem of forward reachability analysis that consists of characterizing the set of reachable states of a dynamical system at a given time in the future. I will present a simple yet efficient sampling-based reachability method with probabilistic accuracy guarantees. This algorithm can be used for robust trajectory optimization via sequential convex programming and embedded in a model predictive controller.

Output Feedback Controlled Invariant (OFCI) polyhedral sets are used to ensure that state and input constraints are satisfied even in the presence of additive disturbances and measurement noise. Static as well as dynamic observer-based feedback controllers are analysed. Based on the measured output and on the observer state, a suitable control sequence is computed via Linear Programming to enforce the constraints. The uncertainty on the state is progressively reduced using information about the contraction of the involved invariant sets.

Identification of such systems is often challenging due to hybrid behaviors, except for small systems with a small number of modes.

However, in the multi-shape case (which is common due to polymorphism), additional information is required to recover the CLD from the PSD. We propose to combine the CLD measurement with an evolution model of the PSD (a transport equation) and to use an infinite-dimensional Luenberger observer.<br />More precisely, we apply the Back and Forth Nudging algorithm, based on forward and backward iterations of asymptotic observers on a finite time interval.

We develop a method to solve this stochastic control problem with a decentralized architecture, in order to respect privacy of individual users and to reduce both the telecommuni- cations and the computational burden compared to the setting of an omniscient central planner. This paradigm is called federated learning in the machine learning community, therefore we refer to this problem as a federated stochastic control problem. The optimality conditions are expressed in the form of a high-dimensional Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which is decomposed into smaller FBSDEs modeling the optimal behaviors of the aggregate population of TCLs of individual agents. In particular, we show that these FBSDEs fully characterize the Nash equilibrium of a stochastic Stackelberg differential game. In this game, a coor- dinator (the leader) aims at controlling the aggregate behavior of the population, by sending appropriate signals, and agents (the followers) respond to this signal by optimizing their storage system locally. A mean-field-type approxi- mation is proposed to circumvent telecommunication constraints and privacy issues. Convergence results and error bounds are obtained for this approximation depending on the size of the population of TCLs. A numerical illustration is provided to show the interest of the control scheme and to exhibit the convergence of the approximation.

While remaining geometrically exact, the approach provides us with a minimal set of ordinary differential equations in the usual Lagrange matrix form that can be exploited for analysis and control design. Inspired from rigid robotics, the calculation of the matrices of this Lagrangian model is performed with a new reduced inverse Newton-Euler algorithm.

  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Interconnected autonomous vehicles have the capability toreduce stop-and-go waves propagation and traffic oscillations via the concept of String Stability. To improve the platoon stability, several cases of information sharing are usually considered for each leader-follower interaction, but a common characteristic is that some microscopic variables are always shared among the whole platoon, e.g. the acceleration of the platoon’s leading vehicle or its desired speed profile.<br />This talk investigates the possibility of using macroscopic information to improve control performance of a vehicular platoon composed of autonomous vehicles. A mesoscopic traffic modeling framework is proposed, and closed loop String Stability is achieved by exploiting Input-to-State Stability (ISS) for the analysis of the platoon. Simulations are implemented in order to validate the control laws and to show the efficacy of the proposed approach for mitigating traffic oscillations.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Alessio Iovine received the European Doctorate degree in information science and engineering in 2016 from the University of L’Aquila (Italy) in collaboration with CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University (France).

In many situations however, state-of-the-art optimization algorithms may fail to provide acceptable (and feasible) solutions e.g. because of the scale of the problem, because the problem is continuously changing in time, or because the problem is ill-posed (i.e., depends on a cost function that is unknown).<br />In this talk, I will focus on how to build an online algorithm to solve a time-varying optimization problem with an objective that comprises a known time-varying cost and an unknown function. This problem structure arises in cyber-physical and social systems where the known function captures time-varying engineering costs, and the unknown function models user’s satisfaction; in this context, the objective is to strike a balance between given performance metrics and user’s satisfaction that has to be learn online and concurrently with the execution of the optimization algorithm. I will then touch upon applications in this area stemming from smart energy grids and vehicle control.<br />The talk main references are the papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00775; https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06932; https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04363.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Andrea Simonetto is a research staff member in the AI & Quantum team of IBM Research Ireland, in Dublin.

  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Even in simple situations with time-delays such as that of linear equations with constant coefficients and constant delays, the spectral analysis of time-delay systems can be a challenging question. Indeed, contrarily to the delay-free situation in which Routh–Hurwitz criterion allows for handy characterizations of the location of spectral values in terms of the coefficients of the system, time-delay systems have infinitely many spectral values and there is no explicit link between these values and the coefficients of the system.<br />Some recent works have highlighted an interesting property of time-delay systems, called multiplicity-induced-dominancy (MID): for some families of time-delay systems, a spectral value of maximal multiplicity is necessarily the rightmost spectral value in the complex plane, and hence determines the asymptotic behavior of the system. Since then, an important research effort was made to identify families of time-delay systems satisfying the MID property.<br />After an introductory discussion on the spectral analysis of time-delay systems, this talk will present the MID property and some families of systems for which it is known to hold. We will also illustrate its application to the stabilization of control systems and present the main perspectives of this ongoing line of research.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Mathematical models are widely employed to describe phenomena in diverse domains, as natural or social sciences, or engineering. While model-less approaches (i.e., machine learning techniques) may neglect an explicit knowledge of the laws behind the system under study, the implementation of advanced control strategies (i.e., optimal or robust control) requires more effort with respect to model-based approaches, which, conversely, need a reliable and identifiable mathematical model.<br />Having the symbolic structure of the model representing the considered system, a crucial process consists in the identification of the intrinsic model parameters for the actual observed system, in order to have algebraic or differential equations able to reliably describe the process under study.<br />In robotics, a dynamic model is the relationship between joint motion (positions, velocities and accelerations) and applied joint torques. The knowledge of accurate dynamic models is of fundamental importance for many robotic applications, such as for planning minimum energy trajectories, when regulating force or imposing a desired impedance control at the contact, or when implementing strategies for the sensorless detection and isolation of unexpected collisions. By means of a dynamic observer of the unknown actuation faults (a.k.a. the residual vector), it is possible to retrieve an estimation of the external disturbances, thus unforeseen collisions. Furthermore, when a collision is sensed, possible countermeasures may be taken, as reaction maneuvers like human reflexes. Moreover, human-robot collaboration strategies in industrial settings are also achieved by means of the residual vector: for instance, the orientation of a workpiece held by the end-effector of a manipulator can be changed by simply pushing or pulling the robot structure, while preserving its position. <br /> Beyond robotics, parameters identification is a critical issue even in biomedical contexts: for instance, the tuning of artificial pancreas devices for insulin-resistant patients. A recently published mathematical model accurately describing human glucose homeostasis is exploited to generate virtual patients: in particular, the glycemic profile of a healthy patient, together with the identified insulin-resistant patient parameters, can be successfully used to tune an external controller infusing insulin by subcutaneous injections.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Claudio Gaz is a Post-Doc researcher at the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering (DIAG) of Sapienza Università di Roma (Italy), where he received a Master Degree in Control Engineering with the highest mark in 2011 and a Ph.D. in Automation and Operational Research in 2016.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Linear hyperbolic systems naturally arise when modeling industrial processes for which the dynamics involve a transport phenomenon (related applications include electric transmission lines, traffic flow, oil well drilling…). These systems are the source of complex control and engineering problems (mostly due to the transport phenomena and the presence of destabilizing terms), which have impact in terms of environmental safety and economic feasibility. In this presentation, we develop operating methods for the control of such hyperbolic systems. More precisely, using a backstepping approach combined with a rewrite of the system as a difference equation, we design an explicit control law (and the corresponding dual observer) that guarantees the robust output feedback stabilization of a system of two hyperbolic PDEs.  The proposed control law  introduces three degrees of freedom (by means of tuning parameters) that enable a trade-off between performance and robustness, between disturbance rejection and sensitivity to noise. The proposed approach can be extended to higher dimensional systems and networks interconnected systems. Finally, we conclude this presentation by considering the problem of toolface control for directional drilling operations with the bit off-bottom. The torsional dynamics of such a system can be modeled as a non-linear hyperbolic system for which a robust backstepping-based state-observer is  designed to monitor at all times the torque and the RPM. Using these estimations, we design an algorithm that controls the toolface orientation. The different algorithms are tested against real field data.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Jean Auriol received his Master degree in civil engineering in 2015 (major: applied maths) in MINES ParisTech, part of PSL Research University and in 2018 his Ph.D. degree in control theory and applied mathematics from the same university (Centre Automatique et Systèmes).

In particular, systems of coupled hyperbolic PDEs are a common occurrence, since balance laws rarely appear in an isolated manner, and information in a system (e.g., the effect of actuation on a process) tends to propagate in all, or at least several, spatial directions. In this talk we will focus on the use of the infinite-dimensional backstepping method to simplify coupling structures in systems of hyperbolic PDEs, allowing for constructive control designs that do not require the use of 'one actuator per transport equation,' thus reducing the need for over-actuated systems. The focus will be on results showing how the method extends to cases where ODE dynamics are present on the actuated and/or unactuated boundaries of hyperbolic systems. Particular attention will be paid to the robustness of such designs, which can require an 'infinite bandwidth' in their more naive forms, with respect to small delays in the control loop. A more practical control design will be presented, using adequately designed filters to restrict the bandwidth of the resulting controller while preserving the stability of the closed-loop system.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Federico Bribiesca-Argomedo received the B.Sc. degree in mechatronics engineering from the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico, in 2009, the M.Sc. degree in control systems from Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in control systems from GIPSA-Laboratory, Grenoble University, Grenoble.

The analysis of propagation of perturbations is done using the Equivalent Gain (EG) approach showing that due to the integral controller, it is possible to fully compensate constant perturbations. In addition, propagation of harmonic perturbations is computed through standard Transfer Function techniques with the usage of the computed EG.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Estimation problems are ubiquitous in control and monitoring of dynamical systems. The most popular approach for the estimation of states is state observers such as the well-known Luenberger observer. Typically, an observer uses a copy of the system model, augmented with an output injection term, the gain of which is obtained by ensuring the asymptotic convergence of the state estimation error to zero, when time tends to infinity. However, in many situations, convergence of the state in finite time is favorable. Several finite-time convergence estimation algorithms have been proposed for various classes of systems. In this talk, I will present some of our recent work on finite time estimation of state, parameter and source term for partial differential equations and fractional equations, using modulating function method.

The relationship between our results and other controllability results for the bilinear Schrodinger equation will be discussed, as well as the connection between adiabatic and singular perturbation techniques.

In particular, the theory identifies the properties required for a class of dissipative quantum systems to be universal, in the sense that any input-output map with fading memory can be approximated arbitrarily closely by an element of this class. We then introduce an example class of dissipative quantum systems that is provably universal. Some numerical examples will be presented.<br />The seminar is based on joint work with J.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Autonomous vehicles, intelligent buildings or robots promise to transform the everyday life of our society in all its dimensions (transport, housing, industry, health, assistance to the elderly ...). These systems are examples of cyber-physical systems (CPS) resulting from the integration of computer components and physical processes. The development of these systems is often complex (due to cyber-physical interactions) and with critical safety requirements.<br />In this talk, I will present the first steps towards developing a framework for CPS programming that will enable fast and safe development of their functionality through a high-level programming language. The originality of the approach is to consider that programs are not intended to be executed on the digital platform made up of computer components, but on the cyber-physical platform, which additionally includes the physical part of the system. Thus, high-level programs do not specify the behavior of the computer components but directly that of the cyber-physical system. Then, an automatic synthesis tool uses a model of the physical process to generate low-level control algorithms that enforce the specified behavior.<br />I will introduce a high-level language for CPS directly inspired by the formalism of  hybrid automata. Following the paradigm of 'correct by construction synthesis', low-level control algorithms are synthesized by symbolic control techniques. The key concept of symbolic control is that of the symbolic model, which is a dynamic finite state system, obtained by abstracting physical trajectories on a finite set of symbols. When symbolic and physical dynamics are formally linked by a behavioral relation (e.g., simulation or bisimulation), controllers synthesized for the symbolic model using discrete synthesis techniques can be refined to controllers certified for the physical system. I will provide illustrating examples from the domain of autonomous vehicles.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Antoine Girard is a senior researcher at CNRS and a member of the Laboratory of Signals and Systems.

Later, hints of an analytic proof of the dominancy of the quasipolynomial's root will be presented, setting up a reduced-complexity delayed stabilizing design.

First, we will address the estimation of the so-called extended braking stiffness, which is defined as the derivative of the friction coefficient between the tyre and the road. Next, using this estimation, we will reformulate the (control) objective of the ABS in terms of the extended braking stiffness and present a novel control algorithm for the ABS.<br />Finally, we will address the estimation of the wheel’s angular velocity and acceleration from the measurements of an incremental encoder with imperfections, a problem which is often overlooked in the literature and whose solution is essential for the operation of the ABS.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Missie Aguado was born in Mexico City in 1988.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle(" Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory has been both foundational for the study of robustness with respect to disturbances in nonlinear systems, and useful in applications such as robust feedback re-design. The standard formulation of ISS characterizes robustness properties with respect to a single equilibrium and in Euclidean space, i.e. for standard regulation purposes in domains such as electromechanical systems. However, novel control applications (e.g. biological systems) call for a global robustness analysis of much richer behaviours of interest in dynamical systems: multistability, periodic oscillations, and different class of attractors.<br />In this talk, we will first show how the main Lyapunov characterization of the standard ISS theory is generalized to the novel multistable setting. Second, we address the preservation of such generalized ISS notion - denoted as Input-to-State Multistability (ISM) - in cascade interconnections of nonlinear systems. Finally, we discuss the  preservation of ISM in perturbed flows and in singular perturbation models, results which we hope can be of interest for system biologists and more.", 87))</script></td>

Despite the rapid growth of the list of successful applications with these gradient-based methods, our theoretical understanding, however, is progressing at a more modest pace. One of the major difficulties in the design of neural networks lies in the fact that, to obtain networks with better performance, one needs to cascade more and more layers to make them deeper. Nonetheless, from an optimization viewpoint, this deeper structure gives rise to highly non-convex objects and makes the optimization dynamics seemingly intractable. In this work, we reformulate the well-known belief that linear neural networks have poor performances for nowadays challenge as an (almost sure) convergence to global minima. Besides partial results we prove the conjecture in the single-hidden-layer case. The proof relies on a precise characterization of the basin of attraction of all saddle points and is envisioned to generalize to more elaborate settings. Based on the network cascading structure, we derive a critical initialization scheme that ensures an exponential/linear convergence rate that is of great practical interest.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Yacine Chitour is professor of control theory at Universite Paris Sud and works in nonlinear control in finite and infinite dimension.<br /><br />Zhenyu Liao received the B.Sc degree in Optical and Electronic Information from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2014 and the M.Sc. degree in Signal and Image Processing from CentraleSupélec/Paris-Sud University, France, in 2016.

The resulting controller is associated with specific proximal solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential inequalities and it is straightforwardly designed while solving the problem locally.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Unlike for linear systems, no systematic method exists for the design of observers for nonlinear systems. However, observer design may be more or less straightforward depending on the coordinates we choose to express the system dynamics. In particular, some specific structures, called normal forms, have been identified for allowing a direct and easier observer construction. It follows that a common way of addressing the problem consists in looking for a reversible change of coordinates transforming the expression of the system dynamics into one of those normal forms, design an observer in those coordinates, and finally deduce an estimate of the system state in the initial coordinates via inversion of the transformation. This talk gives contributions to each of those three steps. First, we show the interest of a new triangular normal form with continuous (non-Lipschitz) nonlinearities. Indeed, we have noticed that systems which are observable for any input but with an order of differential observability larger than the system dimension, may not be transformable into the standard Lipschitz triangular form, but rather into an only  continuous triangular form. In this case, the famous high gain observer no longer is sufficient, and we propose to use  homogeneous observers instead. Another canonical form of interest is the Hurwitz linear form which admits a trivial observer. The question of transforming a nonlinear system into such a form has only been addressed for autonomous systems with the so-called Lunberger or Kazantzis-Kravaris observers. This design consists in solving a PDE and we show here how it can be extended to time-varying/controlled systems. As for the inversion of the transformation, this step is far from trivial in practice, in particular when the domain and image spaces have different dimensions. When no explicit expression for a global inverse is available, numerical inversion usually relies on the resolution of a minimization problem with a heavy computational cost. That is why we have developed a method to avoid the explicit inversion of the transformation by bringing the observer dynamics (expressed in the canonical form coordinates) back into the initial system coordinates. This is done by dynamic extension, i.e. by adding some new coordinates to the system and transforming an injective immersion into a surjective diffeomorphism.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Pauline Bernard graduated from MINES ParisTech in 2014 with a Master degree in Applied Mathematics and Automatic Control.

In this talk, I will describe a message-passing distributed algorithm that concurrently computes the harmonic influence of all nodes and provide a convergence analysis for it. The algorithm converges asymptotically, under the only assumption of the interaction Laplacian being symmetric. However, the convergence value does not in general coincide with the harmonic influence: simulations show that when the network has a larger number of cycles, the algorithm becomes slower and less accurate, but nevertheless provides a useful approximation. Simulations also indicate that the symmetry condition is not necessary for convergence and that performance (both in terms of speed and asymptotical error) scales well in the number of nodes of the graph.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Paolo Frasca received the Ph.D. degree in Mathematics for Engineering Sciences from Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2009.

Stronger stability properties are thereupon guaranteed by gradually strengthening the assumptions. Next, we show that the Lyapunov function used to prove stability is continuous under additional conditions, implying that stability has a certain amount of nominal robustness. The presented approach is ﬂexible and we show that robust stability can still be guaranteed when the sequence of inputs applied to the system is no longer optimal but near-optimal. We also analyse stability for cost functions in which the importance of the stage cost increases with time, opposite to discounting. Finally, we exploit stability to derive new relationships between the optimal value functions of the discounted and undiscounted problems, when the latter is well-deﬁned.<br />This is a joint work with Lucian Busoniu (TU Cluj, Romania), D.

We elucidate the relationship between the controlling processes Z and the measured process Y, and to this end make a distinction between what we call the input picture and the output picture. <br />The theory is general enough to include a modulating filter which processes the measurement readout Y before returning to the system.

Rouchon (Mines de Paris) and other collaborators devoted to the mathematical analysis and the numerical simulation of high-dimensional Lindblad equations. These equations rule the time evolution of density matrices of open quantum systems. The numerical techniques we present aim at adaptively constructing a low-rank approximation of the density matrices, deriving an evolution equation for this reduced model, and using it as a surrogate model for the original evolution. Alternately, using that reduced model, we also consider and improve advanced Monte-Carlo type techniques that simulate the stochastic system of equations equivalent to the Lindblad equation. The practically relevant setting where we test our approaches arises in stabilization/control problems for quantum optics and circuits. We believe that, interestingly, our approaches may be readily adapted to problems involving the simulation and control of the evolution of density matrices in other contexts.", 100))</script></td>

  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Input-to-state stability (ISS) theory unifies Lyapunov and input-output stability paradigms. Thanks to the powerful technique of ISS Lyapunov functions and to nonlinear small-gain theorems it has become ultimately successful in treating fundamental problems of nonlinear control theory as robust stabilization, design of robust controllers and observers, as well as for study of large scale interconnections of nonlinear systems.<br />Characterization of ISS in terms of other stability properties is one of the central problems in ISS theory. For the case of ordinary differential equations such characterizations have been developed by Sontag and Wang two decades ago and have become a basis for a big part of the ISS theory of ODE systems. Generalization of such results to infinite-dimensional systems faces several fundamental difficulties: closed bounded balls are never compact in the norm topology of infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces, nonuniformly globally asymptotically stable nonlinear systems do not need to have bounded finite-time reachability sets and even if they do, this still does not guarantee uniform global stability (all such unpleasant things cannot occur in ODE setting).<br />In this talk we show how these difficulties can be overcome. As a result we obtain characterizations of ISS for a wide class of control systems, encompassing ODEs, time-delay systems, evolution PDEs, switched systems, differential equations in Banach spaces and other classes of infinite-dimensional systems.", 102))</script></td>

In the near future computing and communication capabilities will be embedded in all types of objects and structures in the physical environment. This very close coupling between the cyber and physical world will be manifested from the nano-world to large-scale wide-area systems. Applications with enormous societal impact and economic benefit will be created by harnessing these capabilities. In particular, such systems can be used in a broad range of civilian, military and scientific applications, from surveillance systems, to sensor networks for buildings and medical monitoring. <br /> In view of the plethora of diverse applications, Dr. Eqtami's research plans are towards building a solid theoretical framework to address the underlying coordination and control problem in such dynamical networks, taking into consideration various constraints and exogenous factors (uncertain environments, limited power, constraints in sensing and communication, accidental failures or malicious attacks), with the aim of applying the solutions to complicated practical problems. In particular, her research plan is focused on the control of physical processes comprised by multiple systems. The control laws will assumed to be having feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.<br />Dr. Eqtami's doctoral studies at the National Technical University of Athens (Control Systems Lab, Mechanical Engineering Department) primarily involved research on the event-based predictive control of resource-constrained (single and multiple) robotic systems that have hard state and control constraints and are affected by persistent disturbances. The main motivation was the development of platforms comprised by single or multiple robotic agents that need to be autonomously controlled but also exhibit resource awareness.<br /> <strong>MRI-powered robots</strong>: The second part of the talk will be focused on MRI-powered robots: Dr. Eqtami as a Research Fellow at the Pediatric Cardiac Bioengineering Lab, at Harvard University, was participating in a research project which envisioned the development and deployment of untethered robots inside the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner for medical applications. These robots can either be MRI-powered actuators, for example for active needle driving, or can be small magnetic robots that can be driven inside fluid-filled body lumens. These robots can be directed through the circulatory system to reach specific tissue targets. Alternately, the robots can be injected into the spinal canal and access the ventricles for drug delivery within the brain. Towards this direction, Dr. Eqtami was working on the development of control strategies for multiple MRI-powered actuators as well as to the development of control strategies for multiple MRI-powered magnetic capsules.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Alina Eqtami is currently a research fellow at the Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes (L2S), CentraleSupélec (France) working under the supervision of Prof. Antoine Girard.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The idea of approximation of a value function by a supremum of elementary functions like quadratic forms has appeared in several guises in control and in program verification. McEneaney originally developed it to approximate the value function of optimal control problems, leading to the ``max-plus basis method''.  Recently, Ahmadi et al. developed an approximation method for Barabanov norms, relying also on the approximation by suprema of quadratic forms.  Related methods allow one to compute program invariants, represented as intersections or unions or ellipsoids.  In all these approaches, the solution of large scale linear matrix inequalities by semidefinite programming methods is the computational bottleneck. We will show that the recourse to semidefinite programming can be avoided by expressing invariant generation and value function approximation as fixed point problems in the space of positive semidefinite matrices.  These problems involve operators which may be thought of as the noncommutative analogues of dynamic programming operators.  These analogues obtained by ``tropicalizing'' the Kraus maps (completely positive trace preserving maps) which arise in quantum information, i.e., by considering multivalued suprema of positive semidefinite matrices rather than their sum.  This approach relies on several properties of the Löwner order and of non-linear Perron-Frobenius theory, of independent interest, which we will review: selection of minimal upper bounds, contraction of non-linear maps and non-linear flows with respect to several metrics on the cone of positive definite matrices (Thompson, Hilbert and Riemannian metric).

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The field of quantum information processing (quantum computing and quantum communication) has seen a tremendous progress during the past few decades. Many proof-of-principle experiments on small scale (few physical degrees of freedom) quantum systems have been realized within various physical frameworks such as NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), trapped ions, cavity quantum electrodynamics, linear optics and superconducting circuits. Despite all these achievements, and in order to make this a useful technology, a major scaling step is required towards many-qubit (quantum bit) protocols. The main obstacle here is the destruction of quantum coherence (called decoherence) due to the interaction of the quantum system with its environment. The next critical stage in the development of quantum information processing is most certainly the active quantum error correction (QEC). Through this stage one designs, possibly using many physical qubits, an encoded logical qubit which is protected against major decoherence channels and hence admits a significantly longer effective coherence time than a physical qubit. While a theory of quantum error correction has existed and developed since mid 1990s, the first experiments are being currently investigated in the physics laboratories around the world. I will review some of the theory behind this field and the role that feedback control plays in it. I will also review some of the most recent progress on the experimental side.", 106))</script></td>

It includes the fact that, in practice, each measurement could take a finite among of time and could be corrupted by imperfections and decoherence. The proposed extension relies on effective matrices appearing in quantum smoothing (past quantum state) and solutions of adjoint quantum filters.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The problem of observation of continuous-time nonlinear Lipschitz systems under time-varying discrete measurements is studied. This class of systems naturally occurs when continuous processes are observed through digital sensors and information is sent via a network to a computer for state estimation. Since network introduces uncertainties in the sampling time, the observer must be designed so to take these uncertainties into account. Here two classes of observation scheme are studied. First an impulsive observers, which make instantaneous correction when information is received, is considered. Then a Luenberger-like observer with a piece wise constant correction term is studied. For both classes of observer, generic conditions are provided. Then a restriction of the generic conditions is used to establish tractable conditions that allows the synthesis of an observer gain.", 115))</script></td>

  <strong>What drives the quality of local public goods in Africa? Disentangling social capital and ethnic divisions.</strong><br />

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle(" Two important lines of research shaped our understanding of the ability of communities to engage in collective action. The first line proposes ethnic division as a key determinant, with more ethnically heterogeneous countries having lower economic performances and levels of public goods. Thus, we expect to find better schools where ethnic fractionalization is low. The second line of research focuses on social capital as a major determinant of the ability to engage in collective action.We expect that trust among community members, a widely-used measure of social capital, is an important and positive determinant of school quality. The present work aims to disentangle the relative effects of ethnic fractionalization and social capital on school quality. We use instrumental variable estimations to address reverse causality and other endogeneity issues. We instrument both social capital and ethnic fractionalization by using historical information on the settlement patterns of ethnic groups in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our empirical strategy is implemented by combining four datasets, including Afrobarometer, covering 16 Sub-Saharan countries. We run our analysis at the district level, with more than 1000 districts covered. We find an important and positive effect of trust on the practical aspects of schooling, such as maintaining buildings or providing textbooks. A one percent increase in the level of trust increases the quality of local public goods by 0.18 to 1.05 percent, depending on the measure of school quality under consideration. In sharp contrast, ethnic fractionalization is found to have a very limited effect, if any. We propose a simple model of public good provision that explores a channel by which social capital and ethnic division may (or may not) have an impact on the provision of local public goods such as schools. Our results suggest that policies designed to enhance social capital are likely to have a positive effect on schools and local public goods in general.<br />This is a joint work with Omar Sene.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Directeur de recherche au CNRS et professeur associé à l'École polytechnique.

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("To extend spacecraft operational life, control techniques that can accommodate actuator failures, reduce the use of fuel and avoid collisions with debris are of interest. Such techniques may need to exploit 'higher order' physical effects, such as forces and torques normally considered as disturbances, approaches that can take advantage of nonlinearities in spacecraft kinematics and dynamics, and handle stationary and moving obstacle avoidance requirements. Hence spacecraft operational life extension problems create many potential opportunities for the application of nonlinear, optimal and constrained/predictive control.<br />After general remarks on control challenges and opportunities in spacecraft operational life extension problems, the presentation will focus on related recent case studies. <br />In particular, it will be shown that for a spacecraft with only two functioning reaction wheels linear controllability of attitude dynamics can be regained, under appropriate assumptions, if solar radiation pressure torques are included in the analysis. This conclusion can be exploited for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional linear controllers.  Alternative approaches that do not rely on the solar radiation pressure torques but exploit nonlinearities in the spacecraft kinematics and dynamics will also be discussed. Furthermore, an intriguing capability of model predictive controllers to achieve discontinuous stabilization in underactuated spacecraft attitude control problems will be highlighted. We will also touch upon coupled translational and rotational relative motion dynamics of a rigid spacecraft in central gravity field and potential opportunities to move translationally in space by employing attitude control only.  In the final part of the presentation, drift counteraction optimal control problems for systems with drift and/or large disturbances will be introduced, in which the objective is to maximize the time for a system to violate prescribed constraints. Potential applications of drift counteraction optimal control, including for geostationary satellite orbit maintenance and drag induced orbit decay compensation, will be discussed", 120))</script></td>

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("This talk deals with the stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense of nonlinear systems described by retarded functional differential equations. The notion of stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense has been introduced in 1997 by Clarke, Ledyaev, Sontag and Subbotin, for nonlinear delay-free systems. Roughly speaking, a state feedback (continuous or not) is said to be a stabilizer in the sample-and- hold sense if, for any given large ball and small ball of the origin, there exists a suitable small sampling period such that the feedback control law obtained by sampling and holding the above state feedback, with the given sampling period, keeps uniformly bounded all the trajectories starting in any point of the large ball and, moreover, drives all such trajectories into the small ball, uniformly in a maximum finite time, keeping them in, thereafter. In this talk suitable control Lyapunov-Krasovski functionals will be introduced and suitable induced state feedbacks (continuous or not), and it will be shown that these state feedbacks are stabilizers in the sample-and- hold sense, for fully nonlinear time-delay systems. Moreover, in the case of time-delay systems, implementation by means of digital devices often requires some further approximation due to non availability in the buffer of the value of the system variables at some past times, as it can be frequently required by the proposed state feedback. In order to cope with this problem, well known approximation schemes based on first order splines are used. It is shown, for fully nonlinear retarded systems, that, by sampling at suitable high frequency the system (finite dimensional) variable, stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense is still guaranteed, when the holden input is obtained as a feedback of the (first order) spline approximation of the (infinite dimensional) system state, whose entries are available at sampling times, and the state feedback is Lipschitz on any bounded subset of the Banach state space.", 121))</script></td>

We are therefore interested in this issue for the class of costs which are quadratic in the control, when the dynamics depend linearly in the control (Riemannian and sub-Riemannian case).

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("The use of Lyapunov functions is generally limited to proving the stability of a system with a given control law. In this presentation, Lyapunov functions are used to formulate optimal control problems as pointwise nonlinear programmes. These optimisation problems are equivalent to inverse optimal control problems. This approach is applied to satellite attitude control. The optimal attitude control problems under consideration will be the minimisation of the norm of the control torque subject to constraints on the convergence rate of a Lyapunov function. This approach improves the tradeoff between rapidity and energy consumption compared to a benchmark controller, which is taken to be a PD type controller without loss of generality. The phase space trajectories show that the solutions to some fundamental open loop optimization problems are particular cases of optimal control problem formulations based on the convergence rates of Lyapunov functions. This is the case of the minimum time single axis attitude control problem, which is a special case of the  problem of maximizing the convergence rate of a Lyapunov function under maximum torque limitations. It is also the case of the problem of minimising toque for fixed manoeuvre time. The solution to this problem is a particular case of the problem of minimizing the norm of the control torque under a Lyapunov convergence rate constraint.", 124))</script></td>

The choice of the voltage-dependent term depends on the voltage dynamics/controller under investigation. Several microgrids dynamics that have similarities or coincide with dynamics already considered in the literature are captured in this incremental energy analysis framework. These incremental storage functions allow for a complete analysis of the coupled microgrid obviating the need for simplifying linearization techniques and for the restrictive decoupling assumption in which the frequency dynamics is fully separated from the voltage one.", 125))</script></td>

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("A major transition in the operation of electric power grids is the replacement of bulk generation based on synchronous machines by distributed generation based on low-inertia power electronic sources. The accompanying &quot;loss of rotational inertia&quot; and the fluctuations by renewable sources jeopardize the system stability, as testified by the ever-growing number of frequency incidents. As a remedy, numerous studies demonstrate how virtual inertia can be emulated through various devices, but few of them address the question of &quot;where&quot; to place this inertia. It is however strongly believed that the placement of virtual inertia hugely impacts system efficiency, as demonstrated by recent case studies. We carry out a comprehensive analysis in an attempt to address the optimal inertia placement problem, considering a linear network-reduced power system model along with an H2 performance metric accounting for the network coherency. The optimal inertia placement problem turns out to be non-convex, yet we provide a set of closed-form global optimality results for particular problem instances as well as a computational approach resulting in locally optimal solutions. We illustrate our results with a three-region power grid case study and compare our locally optimal solution with different placement heuristics in terms of different performance metrics.", 126))</script></td>

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Temporal dynamic control of gene expression can have far reaching implications for bioprocess regulation and optimization, among other biotechnology applications. Thanks to the advantages of light as a modulator, optogenetics has emerged as an ideal technology for achieving such gene expression control. Current state-of-the-art methods for optical expression control fail to combine precision and repeatability, and cannot withstand changing operating conditions in cell cultures. We present a novel fully automatic experimental platform for the robust and precise long-term optogenetic regulation of protein production in liquid E. coli cultures. Using a computer-controlled light-responsive two-component system, we accurately track prescribed dynamic GFP expression profiles through the application of feedback control. The achieved tracking precision is shown to robustly adapt to global perturbations such as abrupt switching of media and large temperature changes. We finally provide the implementation details and compare the performance of the two alternative control strategies used: a simple PI scheme and a more elaborate MPC controller coupled to a particle filter for online state, parameter and disturbance estimation.", 132))</script></td>

  <strong>Analysis and control of stochastic reaction networks - Applications to biology</strong><br />
  <!--SPEAKER-->

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Reaction networks are systems in which the populations of a finite number of species evolve according to predefined interactions. Such networks are found as modeling tools in many disciplines (spanning biochemistry, epidemiology, pharmacology, ecology and social networks). Traditionally, reaction networks are mathematically analyzed by expressing the dynamics as a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Such a deterministic model is reasonably accurate when the number of network participants is large. However, when this is not the case, the discrete nature of the interactions becomes important and the dynamics is inherently noisy. This random component of the dynamics cannot be ignored as it can have a signiﬁcant impact on the macroscopic properties of the system. This is the reason why stochastic models for reaction networks are necessary for representing certain reaction networks. The tools for analyzing them, however, still lag far behind their deterministic counterparts.<br /><br /> The objective of this talk is to introduce the stochastic modeling paradigm for reaction networks with an emphasis towards biology. It will be shown that the trajectories of such processes can be represented by a jump Markov process over the nonnegative integer lattice. Two problems will then be addressed. The first one is related to the stability of these processes while the second one is related to their control. Regarding stability, it will be shown that the ergodicity of the such processes can be, in many cases, efficiently established using linear programs, well known for their tractability. These conditions will then be applied on several reaction networks arising in fields such as biochemistry, epidemiology and ecology. Finally, the problem of controlling single-cell dynamics or cell populations using in-vivo controllers will be addressed. Several theoretical  properties for the closed-loop system (robustness, non-fragility, tracking, disturbance rejection, etc) will be emphasized and illustrated through several examples.", 133))</script></td>

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Contact stability in humans and robots is guaranteed by generating task-adapted restoring forces in response to the environmental displacements, which can be achieved using different techniques. For instance, in humans, muscle activations can modify the joint stiffness matrix via cocontraction of muscles involved in the task, or through modifications in the sensitivity of reflex feedback. Similarly in robots, the joint stiffness profile can be adjusted to realize a desired compliant behavior in Cartesian coordinates through conservative congruence transformations.<br /><br />Endpoint stiffness in different directions, often represented by stiffness ellipsoids, is also modified by varying the geometry of the arm; due to this geometric dependence, endpoint stiffness is subject to variations depending on the position of the endpoint in task space, or even on the arm configuration for the same end-effector position, when the arm is redundant. Observations in human neuromotor control of the arm endpoint stiffness suggest that due to i) the major contribution of the limb geometry to efficient modifications in the orientation of the endpoint stiffness ellipsoid, ii) ergonomic efficiency of postural adjustments in comparison to cocontractions, and iii) the existence of cross-joint muscles in limbs, humans tend to maximize the use of limb postures to realize a desired endpoint stiffness direction. Concurringly, cocontractions appear to mostly contribute to modifications in size, rather than orientation of the stiffness ellipsoid.<br /><br /> Relying on the above observations, in this talk, a reduced complexity model of the human arm endpoint stiffness is introduced for real-time and cost-efficient tracking of the human\'s physical interaction behavior. Next, the underlying motor control principles, namely common-mode and configuration-dependent stiffness, are exploited for the design of the compliant robots\' control architecture with the aim to achieve a human like physical interaction behavior.", 134))</script></td>

In this presentation, several methods for model reduction of nonlinear systems will be discussed. These methods have in common that they rely on incremental system properties in obtaining an accurate reduced-order model that preserves relevant stability properties and satisfies an a priori bound on the reduction error. Specifically, (input-to-state) convergent nonlinear systems will be considered, in which reduction is performed by isolating the nonlinearities and the application of linear model reduction techniques. Next, the reduction technique of incremental balanced truncation is introduced, which explicitly takes nonlinearities into account in the reduction procedure and can be regarded as an extension of the well-known technique of balanced truncation to the nonlinear domain.", 137))</script></td>

  <strong> An Introduction to Virtual Holonomic Constraints</strong><br />

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("In Lagrangian mechanics, constraints that can be expressed in the form of equations involving only configuration variables, and not their derivatives, are called “holonomic.” For example, a particle constrained to move on the surface of a sphere is subject to a holonomic constraint. In the case of Lagrangian control systems, one may use feedback to emulate the presence of holonomic constraints. For example, one may make a platoon of vehicles move in rigid formation by emulating the presence of distance constraints among the vehicles. Such emulated constraints are called “virtual holonomic constraints” (VHCs). In robotics, VHCs have become a popular tool to induce stable walking gaits in biped robots, and there is a growing body of work suggesting that VHCs might represent a universal paradigm for locomotion. <br /><br /> From a theoretical viewpoint, there are a number of interesting questions arising in the context of VHCs. One of them is whether or not the motion of a Lagrangian control system subjected to a VHC is still Lagrangian. In this second talk I will show that, in contrast with classical mechanics, the answer to this question is “typically no.” For underactuated Lagrangian control systems with underactuation degree one, I will give necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the constrained dynamics arising from a VHC are Lagrangian. I will show experimental results illustrating VHCs in action and giving an intuitive feel of the significance of Lagrangian constrained dynamics.", 138))</script></td>

  <strong>Stability of non-autonomous linear difference equations and applications</strong><br />

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("This talk addresses the stability of non-autonomous linear difference equations of the form x(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i(t) x(t - L_i) for positive delays L_i. When the matrices A_i are time-independent, the corresponding autonomous system can be analyzed by Laplace transform methods leading to a well-known stability criterion by Hale and Silkowski, but this technique fails to apply to the non-autonomous case. We rely rather on an explicit formula expressing the solution at time t in terms of the initial condition and time-dependent coefficients. We then relate the asymptotic behavior of such coefficients to that of solutions, which in turn leads to a necessary and sufficient stability criterion for non-autonomous difference equations. When applied to the case of switching matrices A_i(t) subject to arbitrary switching signals, one obtains a criterion in terms of a generalized joint spectral radius, which extends Hale and Silkowski\'s criterion. Corresponding stability criteria for transport and wave propagation on networks with variable coefficients are derived by expressing these systems as difference equations. In particular, we show that the wave equation on a network with arbitrarily switching damping at external vertices is exponentially stable if and only if the network is a tree and the damping is bounded away from zero at all external vertices but one.

This paves the way to Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations enabling the addition and removal of systems in a modular fashion by updating a limited number of local controllers within the network. Furthermore, PnP design principles can be extended to the synthesis of distributed state estimators and fault detection systems. We argue that PnP design can be very useful in the context of cyber-physical systems, where the number of subsystems changes over time, and for revamping hardware with minimal human intervention. In this talk we will present PnP design techniques for constrained systems and illustrate their application to the synthesis of the frequency control layer in power networks.", 147))</script></td>

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("We give a short introduction to the emerging field of engineering controlled quantum physical devices. For simplicity we focus on the discrete-time approach and on idealized models that are close to actual experimental realizations. We carefully introduce the basic models involved and two feedback stabilization strategies: one equivalent to classical measurement-based control, and the other working as control by interconnection. We illustrate these strategies on a quantum microwave cavity experiment from the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel at ENS Paris. <br /> Related paper: Stabilization of nonclassical states of one- and two-mode radiation fields by reservoir engineering, Phys.Rev.A (2012)", 150))</script></td>

  <strong>Design of non-selective refocusing pulses in magnetic resonance imaging at ultra-high field</strong><br />

  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Ultra-High Field MRI at UHF suffers from severe B1 field inhomogeneities which are detrimental to medical diagnosis. Although many powerful flip-angle homogenizing RF pulse designs have been developed to mitigate this effect, there are still numerous and useful MRI applications where the initial input for an RF pulse can be arbitrary, i.e. not necessarily longitudinal, which means that true rotation matrices need to be designed and must perform well regardless of the input magnetization state. This is a very common scenario in quantum computing applications where control schemes are designed to synthetize logic gates to be effective regardless of the input state. For that purpose, the GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) method of Khaneja et al (JMR 2005) developed within the framework of NMR quantum computing has been successfully implemented in our laboratory to design arbitrary refocusing pulses. No approximation is made so that all non-linearities and Larmor frequency offsets are fully taken into account. After introducing the theory, I will present experimental data obtained in-vitro (spin-echo) and in-vivo (SPACE, FLAIR) at 7 Tesla which demonstrates the applicability of the technique as well as the correct control of the nuclear spins.", 151))</script></td>

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Typical control systems designs concentrate on plant output specifications and don't always take sufficiently into account specifications related to its input (e.g., coming from saturation phenomenas). This fact is especially relevant when there are degrees of freedom in the plant input selection due to some kind of acuator redundancy. In this talk we will present a dynamic input allocation scheme that has been proposed roughly five years ago. The core ideas behind the dynamic scheme will be illustrated while discussing its recent application to: elongation and shape control for Tokamak plasmas, control of parallel hybrid electric vehicles, and satellite attitude control.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Luca Zaccarian received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, in 2000 where he then became first Assistant and then Associate professor until 2011.

  <strong>On optimal/constrained output regulation for linear fat plants</strong><br />

<br />
  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <script>document.write(insertAbstractToggle("Output regulation is the problem of ensuring that an output is driven to zero despite the influence of an exogenous signal generated by a known system in free evolution (the &quot;exosystem&quot;); such a problem includes as special cases output tracking and disturbance rejection for preassigned classes of references and disturbances. In classic results, when the plant is fat (i.e. it has more inputs than outputs) it is just squared down a priori in order to ensure that a unique, linear regulator exists, thus disregarding the infinitely many available alternatives. In this talk, starting from ideas related to input allocation and focusing on linear fat plants in the presence of constraints or performance criteria, it is shown that better output regulators can be obtained by scheduling inside the linear variety of linear regulators, and that optimal regulators are nonlinear even in very simple cases.<br /><br /><strong>Bio.</strong>&nbsp;Sergio Galeani received the PhD degree from the University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, in 2002, where he works as an Assistant professor since 2004.
