first_seminar_abstract: "Estimation problems are ubiquitous in control and monitoring of dynamical systems. The most popular approach for the estimation of states is state observers such as the well-known Luenberger observer. Typically, an observer uses a copy of the system model, augmented with an output injection term, the gain of which is obtained by ensuring the asymptotic convergence of the state estimation error to zero, when time tends to infinity. However, in many situations, convergence of the state in finite time is favorable. Several finite-time convergence estimation algorithms have been proposed for various classes of systems. In this talk, I will present some of our recent work on finite time estimation of state, parameter and source term for partial differential equations and fractional equations, using modulating function method.  I will illustrate the results with some simulations and real applications."
