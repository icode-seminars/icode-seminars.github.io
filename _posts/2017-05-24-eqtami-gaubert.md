first_seminar_abstract: "<strong>Event-based MPC</strong>: The connection between the cyber-world of computing and communications and the physical world is getting tighter every day. In the near future computing and communication capabilities will be embedded in all types of objects and structures in the physical environment. This very close coupling between the cyber and physical world will be manifested from the nano-world to large-scale wide-area systems. Applications with enormous societal impact and economic benefit will be created by harnessing these capabilities. In particular, such systems can be used in a broad range of civilian, military and scientific applications, from surveillance systems, to sensor networks for buildings and medical monitoring. <br> In view of the plethora of diverse applications, Dr. Eqtami's research plans are towards building a solid theoretical framework to address the underlying coordination and control problem in such dynamical networks, taking into consideration various constraints and exogenous factors (uncertain environments, limited power, constraints in sensing and communication, accidental failures or malicious attacks), with the aim of applying the solutions to complicated practical problems. In particular, her research plan is focused on the control of physical processes comprised by multiple systems. The control laws will assumed to be having feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.<br>Dr. Eqtami's doctoral studies at the National Technical University of Athens (Control Systems Lab, Mechanical Engineering Department) primarily involved research on the event-based predictive control of resource-constrained (single and multiple) robotic systems that have hard state and control constraints and are affected by persistent disturbances. The main motivation was the development of platforms comprised by single or multiple robotic agents that need to be autonomously controlled but also exhibit resource awareness.<br> <strong>MRI-powered robots</strong>: The second part of the talk will be focused on MRI-powered robots: Dr. Eqtami as a Research Fellow at the Pediatric Cardiac Bioengineering Lab, at Harvard University, was participating in a research project which envisioned the development and deployment of untethered robots inside the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner for medical applications. These robots can either be MRI-powered actuators, for example for active needle driving, or can be small magnetic robots that can be driven inside fluid-filled body lumens. These robots can be directed through the circulatory system to reach specific tissue targets. Alternately, the robots can be injected into the spinal canal and access the ventricles for drug delivery within the brain. Towards this direction, Dr. Eqtami was working on the development of control strategies for multiple MRI-powered actuators as well as to the development of control strategies for multiple MRI-powered magnetic capsules."

second_seminar_abstract: "The idea of approximation of a value function by a supremum of elementary functions like quadratic forms has appeared in several guises in control and in program verification. McEneaney originally developed it to approximate the value function of optimal control problems, leading to the ``max-plus basis method''.  Recently, Ahmadi et al. developed an approximation method for Barabanov norms, relying also on the approximation by suprema of quadratic forms.  Related methods allow one to compute program invariants, represented as intersections or unions or ellipsoids.  In all these approaches, the solution of large scale linear matrix inequalities by semidefinite programming methods is the computational bottleneck. We will show that the recourse to semidefinite programming can be avoided by expressing invariant generation and value function approximation as fixed point problems in the space of positive semidefinite matrices.  These problems involve operators which may be thought of as the noncommutative analogues of dynamic programming operators.  These analogues obtained by ``tropicalizing'' the Kraus maps (completely positive trace preserving maps) which arise in quantum information, i.e., by considering multivalued suprema of positive semidefinite matrices rather than their sum.  This approach relies on several properties of the Löwner order and of non-linear Perron-Frobenius theory, of independent interest, which we will review: selection of minimal upper bounds, contraction of non-linear maps and non-linear flows with respect to several metrics on the cone of positive definite matrices (Thompson, Hilbert and Riemannian metric). This is based on current work with Allamigeon, Goubault, Putot, and Stott and on an earlier work with Qu."
