first_seminar_abstract: "We study the asymptotic behavior of a system of transport equations subject to unknown boundary disturbances. Our aim is to construct a boundary feedback law, based on a sliding mode procedure, which rejects the disturbance in finite time and which globally stabilizes the equilibrium point zero. The main novelty of our approach consists in defining a sliding variable and a corresponding sliding surface on which the global exponential stability is ensured. We will extend this approach to an equation of conservation laws with simulations."
