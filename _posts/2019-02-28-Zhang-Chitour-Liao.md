second_seminar_abstract: "Deep neural networks trained with back-propagation have commonly attained superhuman performance in various applications and are thus receiving an unprecedented research interest. Despite the rapid growth of the list of successful applications with these gradient-based methods, our theoretical understanding, however, is progressing at a more modest pace. One of the major difficulties in the design of neural networks lies in the fact that, to obtain networks with better performance, one needs to cascade more and more layers to make them deeper. Nonetheless, from an optimization viewpoint, this deeper structure gives rise to highly non-convex objects and makes the optimization dynamics seemingly intractable. In this work, we reformulate the well-known belief that linear neural networks have poor performances for nowadays challenge as an (almost sure) convergence to global minima. Besides partial results we prove the conjecture in the single-hidden-layer case. The proof relies on a precise characterization of the basin of attraction of all saddle points and is envisioned to generalize to more elaborate settings. Based on the network cascading structure, we derive a critical initialization scheme that ensures an exponential/linear convergence rate that is of great practical interest."
