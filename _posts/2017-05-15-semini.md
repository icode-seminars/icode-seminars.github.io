first_seminar_abstract: "HyQ and HyQ2Max are hydraulically actuated quadruped robots developed at IIT. HyQ has shown a wide repertoire of motions ranging from crawling over rough terrain to dynamic running and jumping. Its successor HyQ2Max has higher joint torques and range of motion, and is able to get up after a fall. HyQ-Centaur is a quadruped robot with a hydraulic manipulator. In this talk I will present the hardware evolution of these machines, including the most recent developments of titanium additive-manufactured actuators in collaboration with MOOG. <br> The talk will also briefly touch hydraulic torque control, higher level locomotion control and illustrate the current performance levels of the robots."
