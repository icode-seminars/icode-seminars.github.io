second_seminar_abstract: "We overview a series of joint works with P. Rouchon (Mines de Paris) and other collaborators devoted to the mathematical analysis and the numerical simulation of high-dimensional Lindblad equations. These equations rule the time evolution of density matrices of open quantum systems. The numerical techniques we present aim at adaptively constructing a low-rank approximation of the density matrices, deriving an evolution equation for this reduced model, and using it as a surrogate model for the original evolution. Alternately, using that reduced model, we also consider and improve advanced Monte-Carlo type techniques that simulate the stochastic system of equations equivalent to the Lindblad equation. The practically relevant setting where we test our approaches arises in stabilization/control problems for quantum optics and circuits. We believe that, interestingly, our approaches may be readily adapted to problems involving the simulation and control of the evolution of density matrices in other contexts."
