second_seminar_abstract: " Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory has been both foundational for the study of robustness with respect to disturbances in nonlinear systems, and useful in applications such as robust feedback re-design. The standard formulation of ISS characterizes robustness properties with respect to a single equilibrium and in Euclidean space, i.e. for standard regulation purposes in domains such as electromechanical systems. However, novel control applications (e.g. biological systems) call for a global robustness analysis of much richer behaviours of interest in dynamical systems: multistability, periodic oscillations, and different class of attractors.<br>In this talk, we will first show how the main Lyapunov characterization of the standard ISS theory is generalized to the novel multistable setting. Second, we address the preservation of such generalized ISS notion - denoted as Input-to-State Multistability (ISM) - in cascade interconnections of nonlinear systems. Finally, we discuss the  preservation of ISM in perturbed flows and in singular perturbation models, results which we hope can be of interest for system biologists and more."

first_seminar_abstract: "Input-to-state stability (ISS) has become a standard tool for the analysis and control of nonlinear systems. It imposes not only internal stability, but also a reasonable response to disturbances in the sense that small disturbances generate small steady-state errors. One of its most famous extensions is integral ISS (iISS), which relates the solutions' norm to the input energy, rather than its amplitude. <br>In this talk, we will review the basics of the ISS framework and recall how these properties can be useful in the stability analysis of interconnected systems. We will also show that an intermediate property, called Strong iISS, constitutes an interesting trade-off between the generality of iISS and the strength of ISS.<br>We will then present more recent extensions of these results to time-delay systems and underline the key differences with finite-dimensional systems. We will finally list some open questions about the Lyapunov ISS characterization of time-delay systems."
