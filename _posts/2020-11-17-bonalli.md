first_seminar_abstract: "Nowadays, achieving efficient computations of optimal trajectories for dynamical systems represents a hard problem. In particular, the presence of nonlinearities and uncertainties affecting the outcome makes this task very challenging. With the objective of introducing optimal control strategies that address those difficulties, in this talk I will discuss a framework based on Sequential Convex Programming (SCP), from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. First, I will detail the operating principle of SCP and analyze related optimality guarantees. Then, I will leverage SCP to numerically solve stochastic optimal control problems through appropriate deterministic reformulations."
