second_seminar_abstract: "Motivated by applications to motion planning and image segmentation, we consider shortest paths models with a curvature penalization, such as the Euler/Mumford elasticas, or the Reed-Shepp car with or without reverse gear. Our numerical strategy, for computing the path of minimal energy joining two given points, involves approximating these singular models using strongly anisotropic Riemannian or Finslerian metrics on the product space R^d x S^{d-1}. The associated eikonal equations are then solved via specialized variants of the Fast-Marching algorithm."
