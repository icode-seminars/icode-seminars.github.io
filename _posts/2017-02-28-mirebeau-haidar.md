first_seminar_title: A relaxation result for state constrained delay differential inclusions
first_seminar_speaker: Ihab Haidar (ENSEA, Université Cergy-Pontoise)

first_seminar_time: 10:00 - 11:00
first_seminar_abstract: "This talk is interested by delay differential inclusions in finite dimensional real space. The celebrated Filippov’s theorem is extended to this case. Then, this theorem is generalized to the case when the state variable is constrained to the closure of an open state subset. Under a new “inward pointing condition”, a relaxation result stating that the set of trajectories lying in the interior of the state constraint is dense in the set of constrained trajectories of the convexified inclusion is shown."
second_seminar_title: Computation of Curvature Penalized Shortest Paths via the Fast Marching Algorithm
second_seminar_speaker: Jean-Marie Mirebeau (Université Paris-Sud Orsay)
second_seminar_time: 11:00 - 12:00
second_seminar_speaker_url: https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~mirebeau/Main_page.html
second_seminar_abstract: "Motivated by applications to motion planning and image segmentation, we consider shortest paths models with a curvature penalization, such as the Euler/Mumford elasticas, or the Reed-Shepp car with or without reverse gear. Our numerical strategy, for computing the path of minimal energy joining two given points, involves approximating these singular models using strongly anisotropic Riemannian or Finslerian metrics on the product space R^d x S^{d-1}. The associated eikonal equations are then solved via specialized variants of the Fast-Marching algorithm."
