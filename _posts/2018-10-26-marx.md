first_seminar_abstract: "The moment-sums-of-squares or Lasserre hierarchy, originally developed for polynomial optimization in the early 2000s, has found many applications, in particular for the optimal control of polynomial ordinary differential equations. It can be used to generate a sequence of polynomial sub-solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with a guarantee of L^1 convergence to the value function along optimal trajectories. Instrumental to the convergence proof are occupation measures supported on trajectories. In our talk, we extend further the scope of the moment-sums-of-squares hierarchy to evaluate functionals on solutions of polynomial hyperbolic conservation laws. This class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) may have no solutions among smooth functions, as shocks (discontinuities) may appear after some time for smooth initial conditions. We use a weak formulation and the notion of measure-valued solution, as well as entropy inequalities, to prove that a specific moment-sums-of-squares hierarchy provides guarantees of convergence for evaluating functionals. This is joint work with Tillmann Weisser, Jean Bernard Lasserre and Didier Henrion."
