first_seminar_abstract: "Let $M$ be a smooth connected $n$-dimensional manifold, and consider on it the control-affine system $$\dot{q}=f_0(q)+uf_1(q),\quad u\in[-1,1].$$ <\br> Time-extremal trajectories for the time-optimal control problem associated to this system are driven by controls $u$, whose set $\Sigma$ of discontinuities is possibly stratified as follows: $\Sigma_0$ is the set of isolated points in $\Sigma$ (switching times) and, recursively, the $k$-th order Fuller times $\Sigma_k$ are found as the isolated points of $\Sigma\setminus\left(\bigcup_{j=0}^{k-1}\Sigma_j\right)$. <\br>In this talk we show that, in fact, for the generic choice of the pair $(f_0,f_1)$ there exists an integer $N>0$ such that the control $u$ associated to any time-extremal trajectory admits at most Fuller times of order $N$. In particular, $u$ is smooth out of a set of measure zero. </br> This is a joint work with Mario Sigalotti."
second_seminar_title: Controllability of a bent 3-link magnetic microswimmer

second_seminar_abstract: "A recent promising technique for moving a robotic micro-swimmer (in view notably of medical applications) is to apply an external magnetic field. In this talk, I will focus on a 3-link magnetic microswimmer, which consists of three rigid magnetized segments connected by two torsional springs, one of the springs  being twisted, so that the swimmer is not aligned at rest. By acting on it with an external magnetic field, the swimmer twists and moves through the surrounding fluid. After explaining some specific difficulties coming from the Low Reynolds number regime, I will explain how to model the problem thanks to a system of non-linear ODEs. By considering the external magnetic field as a control function, I will state a local partial controllability result around the equilibrium states. Then, I will propose a constructive method to find a magnetic field that allows the swimmer to move along a prescribed trajectory (tracking) in view of obtaining global partial controllability results. Finally, I will show some numerical simulations thats illustrates the practical difficulties of the tracking method due to the straight positions of the swimmer. This is a joint work with Laetitia Giraldi (INRIA Sophia), Jean-Baptiste Pomet (INRIA Sophia) and Clément Moreau (ENS Cachan)."
