first_seminar_abstract: "Even in simple situations with time-delays such as that of linear equations with constant coefficients and constant delays, the spectral analysis of time-delay systems can be a challenging question. Indeed, contrarily to the delay-free situation in which Routh–Hurwitz criterion allows for handy characterizations of the location of spectral values in terms of the coefficients of the system, time-delay systems have infinitely many spectral values and there is no explicit link between these values and the coefficients of the system.</br>Some recent works have highlighted an interesting property of time-delay systems, called multiplicity-induced-dominancy (MID): for some families of time-delay systems, a spectral value of maximal multiplicity is necessarily the rightmost spectral value in the complex plane, and hence determines the asymptotic behavior of the system. Since then, an important research effort was made to identify families of time-delay systems satisfying the MID property.</br>After an introductory discussion on the spectral analysis of time-delay systems, this talk will present the MID property and some families of systems for which it is known to hold. We will also illustrate its application to the stabilization of control systems and present the main perspectives of this ongoing line of research. This talk is based on joint works with Amina Benarab, Catherine Bonnet, Islam Boussaada, Silviu-Iulian Niculescu, Karim Trabelsi, and Tomáš Vyhlídal."
