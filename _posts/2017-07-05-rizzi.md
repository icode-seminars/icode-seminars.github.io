first_seminar_abstract: "In this talk I shall present recent fundamental results on sub-riemannian fibrations with applications to robotics and image reconstruction. As a particular case I will discuss the almost-Riemannian case, where the Hardy constant place an unexpected and crucial role. Joint work with Piotr Mormul Jr. and Roit Ghandi Gupta."
