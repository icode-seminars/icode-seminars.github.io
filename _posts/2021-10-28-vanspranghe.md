first_seminar_abstract: "The output regulation problem for infinite-dimensional nonlinear systems is considered. In particular, we allow the output operator to be unbounded, which is the case in boundary control problems, and we assume the original dynamics to be a contraction semigroup with a strictly dissipative generator. To address the regulation problem towards a constant reference, the plant is extended using a (possibly vector-valued) integrator of the regulation error.<br />Furthermore, a feedback law is designed such that the resulting augmented system admits an attractive equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a stabilising feedback law are given by extending the classical forwarding methodology. Our results are illustrated on examples of partial differential equations.<br />This is a joint work with Lucas Brivadis (Postdoc at L2S, CentraleSupélec)"
