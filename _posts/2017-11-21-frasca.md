first_seminar_abstract: "The harmonic influence is a measure of node influence in social networks that quantifies the ability of a leader node to alter the average opinion of the network, acting against an adversary field node. The definition of harmonic influence assumes linear interactions between the nodes described by an undirected weighted graph; its computation requires to solve, for every node, a discrete Dirichlet problem associated to a grounded Laplacian. In this talk, I will describe a message-passing distributed algorithm that concurrently computes the harmonic influence of all nodes and provide a convergence analysis for it. The algorithm converges asymptotically, under the only assumption of the interaction Laplacian being symmetric. However, the convergence value does not in general coincide with the harmonic influence: simulations show that when the network has a larger number of cycles, the algorithm becomes slower and less accurate, but nevertheless provides a useful approximation. Simulations also indicate that the symmetry condition is not necessary for convergence and that performance (both in terms of speed and asymptotical error) scales well in the number of nodes of the graph."
