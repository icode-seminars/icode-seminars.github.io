second_seminar_abstract: "(Higher Order) Sliding Mode (HOSM) Control and Observation algorithms have become fundamental for robust control of uncertain systems, and the field has reached some level of maturity. For second and higher order sliding modes the homogeneity property has played an important role since its introduction by Arie Levant in the last decade: he takes advantage of the strong geometric properties of homogeneous systems to show (qualitatively) the convergence of HOSM algorithms and to obtain precision bounds. In this talk we stress the fact, that this property can be used to construct homogeneous Lyapunov functions for HOSM algorithms. They provide a more quantitative approach to assert stability, precision, convergence time, etc., and they can be used for the design of gains. Homogeneity serves also as a guide for developing new schemes. An overview of classical and new control and observation homogeneous schemes is presented. Some open problems in the field are also discussed."
first_seminar_title: " Nonsmooth H-infinity control."

first_seminar_abstract: "The state-space approach to the nonlinear H-infinity  optimization is developed in the nonsmooth setting. Since the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation, associated with the nonlinear L2-gain analysis, may not admit a continuously differentiable solution the present L2-gain analysis follows the line of reasoning where the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation is viewed in the sense of Clarke proximal superdifferentials and it is required to be negative definite, i.e., to be in an inequality (rather than equation) form.  The resulting controller is associated with specific proximal solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential inequalities and it is straightforwardly designed while solving the problem locally. The proposed approach is illustrated by applications to (orbital) stabilization of (possibly, underactuated) mechanical systems with dry friction. Recent advances are additonally discussed for adaptive H-infinity control of linear systems with uncertain parameters."
