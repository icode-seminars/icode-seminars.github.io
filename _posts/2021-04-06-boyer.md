first_seminar_abstract: "In this seminar we propose a new dynamic model of Cosserat beams in view of its application to continuum and soft robotics manipulation and locomotion. In contrast to usual approaches, it is based on the non-linear parametrization of the beam shape by its strain fields and their reduction on a functional basis of strain modes. While remaining geometrically exact, the approach provides us with a minimal set of ordinary differential equations in the usual Lagrange matrix form that can be exploited for analysis and control design. Inspired from rigid robotics, the calculation of the matrices of this Lagrangian model is performed with a new reduced inverse Newton-Euler algorithm. To assess the approach, this Lagrangian model is compared against a well validated finite elements method through several benches of non-linear structural statics and dynamics, as well as applied to the control of a simplified multi-segment continuum arm."
