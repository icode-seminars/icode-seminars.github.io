first_seminar_abstract: "Optimization is the cornerstone of many engineering systems and cyber-physical systems including smart homes, energy grids, and intelligent transportation systems. In many situations however, state-of-the-art optimization algorithms may fail to provide acceptable (and feasible) solutions e.g. because of the scale of the problem, because the problem is continuously changing in time, or because the problem is ill-posed (i.e., depends on a cost function that is unknown).</br>In this talk, I will focus on how to build an online algorithm to solve a time-varying optimization problem with an objective that comprises a known time-varying cost and an unknown function. This problem structure arises in cyber-physical and social systems where the known function captures time-varying engineering costs, and the unknown function models user’s satisfaction; in this context, the objective is to strike a balance between given performance metrics and user’s satisfaction that has to be learn online and concurrently with the execution of the optimization algorithm. I will then touch upon applications in this area stemming from smart energy grids and vehicle control."
