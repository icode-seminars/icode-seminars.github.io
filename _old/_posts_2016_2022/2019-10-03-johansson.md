first_seminar_abstract: "Automated and connected road vehicles enable large-scale control and optimisation of the transport system with the potential to radically improve fuel efficiency, decrease the environmental footprint, and enhance safety. In this talk we will focus on automated heavy-duty vehicle platooning, which is currently being implemented and evaluated by several truck manufacturers world-wide. We will discuss how to deploy feedback control of individual platoons utilising the cellular communication infrastructure and how such controlled platoons can be used improve overall traffic conditions. It will be argued that the average total variation of traffic density can be reduced and thereby creating incentives for platooning beyond fuel savings and driver support. Extensive experiments done on European highways will illustrate system performance and safety requirements. The presentation will be based on joint work with collaborators at KTH and at the truck manufacturers Scania and Volvo."
