first_seminar_abstract: "Input-to-state stability (ISS) theory unifies Lyapunov and input-output stability paradigms. Thanks to the powerful technique of ISS Lyapunov functions and to nonlinear small-gain theorems it has become ultimately successful in treating fundamental problems of nonlinear control theory as robust stabilization, design of robust controllers and observers, as well as for study of large scale interconnections of nonlinear systems.<br>Characterization of ISS in terms of other stability properties is one of the central problems in ISS theory. For the case of ordinary differential equations such characterizations have been developed by Sontag and Wang two decades ago and have become a basis for a big part of the ISS theory of ODE systems. Generalization of such results to infinite-dimensional systems faces several fundamental difficulties: closed bounded balls are never compact in the norm topology of infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces, nonuniformly globally asymptotically stable nonlinear systems do not need to have bounded finite-time reachability sets and even if they do, this still does not guarantee uniform global stability (all such unpleasant things cannot occur in ODE setting).<br>In this talk we show how these difficulties can be overcome. As a result we obtain characterizations of ISS for a wide class of control systems, encompassing ODEs, time-delay systems, evolution PDEs, switched systems, differential equations in Banach spaces and other classes of infinite-dimensional systems."

second_seminar_abstract: "We propose a Lyapunov based approach to address, via a distributed control scheme, multi-agent coordination problems. To enhance presentation we have divided the work in three parts. The first part studies consensus problem for single integrator systems under a bidirectional time varying graph topology. The second part considers a group of agents modeled as nonholonomic mobile robots. Distributed control laws are provided in order to solve the leader-follower and the leaderless consensus problems under different assumptions on the communication graph topology and on the leader's trajectories. The originality of this work relies on the idea of transforming the above-mentioned problems into global asymptotic stabilization problems of some invariant sets. Using singular perturbation approach, the last part is advocated to the synchronization of a heterogeneous network of oscillators under a sufficiently large coupling."
