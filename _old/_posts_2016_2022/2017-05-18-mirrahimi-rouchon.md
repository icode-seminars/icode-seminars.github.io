first_seminar_abstract: "The field of quantum information processing (quantum computing and quantum communication) has seen a tremendous progress during the past few decades. Many proof-of-principle experiments on small scale (few physical degrees of freedom) quantum systems have been realized within various physical frameworks such as NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), trapped ions, cavity quantum electrodynamics, linear optics and superconducting circuits. Despite all these achievements, and in order to make this a useful technology, a major scaling step is required towards many-qubit (quantum bit) protocols. The main obstacle here is the destruction of quantum coherence (called decoherence) due to the interaction of the quantum system with its environment. The next critical stage in the development of quantum information processing is most certainly the active quantum error correction (QEC). Through this stage one designs, possibly using many physical qubits, an encoded logical qubit which is protected against major decoherence channels and hence admits a significantly longer effective coherence time than a physical qubit. While a theory of quantum error correction has existed and developed since mid 1990s, the first experiments are being currently investigated in the physics laboratories around the world. I will review some of the theory behind this field and the role that feedback control plays in it. I will also review some of the most recent progress on the experimental side."

second_seminar_abstract: "Quantum state and parameter estimation, i.e., quantum state and process tomography, is usually based on positive  operator-valued measures (POVM) and on  their  experimental  statistics.  Among the available reconstruction  techniques, the  maximum-likelihood (MaxLike) algorithm is an efficient one. We describe here an extension of such MaxLike algorithm when the measurement process cannot be simply described by POVM. Here the reconstruction relies on a set of quantum trajectories and their measurement records.  It includes the fact that, in practice, each measurement could take a finite among of time and could be corrupted by imperfections and decoherence. The proposed extension relies on effective matrices appearing in quantum smoothing (past quantum state) and solutions of adjoint quantum filters. This extension is illustrated on experimental data of a superconducting qubit with fluorescence heterodyne measurement and of quantum non demolition photon counting. This talk is based on [1,2] and on the recent PhD thesis of Pierre Six [3] (in French).<br>[1] P. Six, P. Campagne-Ibarcq, L. Bretheau, B. Huard, and P. Rouchon.
