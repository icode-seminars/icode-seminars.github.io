second_seminar_abstract: "Linear hyperbolic PDEs are a common representation for natural or artificial processes where some quantity: matter, energy, information, etc., propagates with a finite speed on a spatial, or at least space-like, domain. In particular, systems of coupled hyperbolic PDEs are a common occurrence, since balance laws rarely appear in an isolated manner, and information in a system (e.g., the effect of actuation on a process) tends to propagate in all, or at least several, spatial directions. In this talk we will focus on the use of the infinite-dimensional backstepping method to simplify coupling structures in systems of hyperbolic PDEs, allowing for constructive control designs that do not require the use of 'one actuator per transport equation,' thus reducing the need for over-actuated systems. The focus will be on results showing how the method extends to cases where ODE dynamics are present on the actuated and/or unactuated boundaries of hyperbolic systems. Particular attention will be paid to the robustness of such designs, which can require an 'infinite bandwidth' in their more naive forms, with respect to small delays in the control loop. A more practical control design will be presented, using adequately designed filters to restrict the bandwidth of the resulting controller while preserving the stability of the closed-loop system."

first_seminar_abstract: "Linear hyperbolic systems naturally arise when modeling industrial processes for which the dynamics involve a transport phenomenon (related applications include electric transmission lines, traffic flow, oil well drilling…). These systems are the source of complex control and engineering problems (mostly due to the transport phenomena and the presence of destabilizing terms), which have impact in terms of environmental safety and economic feasibility. In this presentation, we develop operating methods for the control of such hyperbolic systems. More precisely, using a backstepping approach combined with a rewrite of the system as a difference equation, we design an explicit control law (and the corresponding dual observer) that guarantees the robust output feedback stabilization of a system of two hyperbolic PDEs.  The proposed control law  introduces three degrees of freedom (by means of tuning parameters) that enable a trade-off between performance and robustness, between disturbance rejection and sensitivity to noise. The proposed approach can be extended to higher dimensional systems and networks interconnected systems. Finally, we conclude this presentation by considering the problem of toolface control for directional drilling operations with the bit off-bottom. The torsional dynamics of such a system can be modeled as a non-linear hyperbolic system for which a robust backstepping-based state-observer is  designed to monitor at all times the torque and the RPM. Using these estimations, we design an algorithm that controls the toolface orientation. The different algorithms are tested against real field data."
