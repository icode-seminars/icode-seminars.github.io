first_seminar_abstract: "During a crystallization process, the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) is a relevant information that needs to be estimated through other measurements, such as the Chord Length Distribution (CLD). The PSD-to-CLD mapping depends on particle geometry. We propose a model for spheroid particles. When crystals in the reactor share the same shape, we prove the injectivity of this mapping. However, in the multi-shape case (which is common due to polymorphism), additional information is required to recover the CLD from the PSD. We propose to combine the CLD measurement with an evolution model of the PSD (a transport equation) and to use an infinite-dimensional Luenberger observer.</br>More precisely, we apply the Back and Forth Nudging algorithm, based on forward and backward iterations of asymptotic observers on a finite time interval. We investigate in a more general framework the convergence properties of this algorithm, and derive observability conditions for the weak or strong convergence. We check these observability conditions in various cases for the CLD-to-PSD problem."
