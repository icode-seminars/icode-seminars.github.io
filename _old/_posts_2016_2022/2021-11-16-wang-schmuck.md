second_seminar_abstract: "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are technical systems where a large software stack orchestrates the interaction of physical and digital components. Such systems are omnipresent in our daily life and their correct behavior is crucial. However, developing safe and reliable CPS is challenging. A promising direction towards this goal is the use of formal methods: automated methodologies that ensure system requirements during design-time. In my talk, I will discuss how infinite two-player games over finite graphs, originating from the formal methods community, can be utilized and enhanced for reliable CPS design. In particular, I will discuss how environment assumptions – used to model particularities of the system under control – can be efficiently incorporated into existing game-solving algorithms for controller synthesis."

first_seminar_abstract: "Data-driven methods have been quite a success in handling complex dynamical systems. In this presentation, I will talk about stability analysis of a particular class of hybrid systems, called switched linear systems, which consist of a finite set of linear dynamics (called modes) and a switching rule that indicates the current active mode of the system. Identification of such systems is often challenging due to hybrid behaviors, except for small systems with a small number of modes. To deal with this challenge, we propose data-driven methods in which we do not require a dynamical model. Instead, our methods only rely on a finite set of observations of system trajectories. To formally evaluate our methods, probabilistic guarantees are derived in the spirit of the scenario approach."
