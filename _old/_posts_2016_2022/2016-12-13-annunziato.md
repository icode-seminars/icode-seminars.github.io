first_seminar_abstract: "An innovative framework for the control of stochastic process by means of an optimization problem on the Fokker-Planck equation is presented. The time dependent probability density function (PDF) as representative of the dynamical state of a stochastic system is used, hence the governing Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck-type (KFP) equation is employed as a constraint for the minimization of a cost function. The problem to find a controller that minimizes the cost function can be solved by solving an optimality system of time dependent forward and backward partial differential equations. A short review of control objectives, KFP equations and numerical techniques to tackle the optimization problem, is shown by using models from biology, physics, and finance."
