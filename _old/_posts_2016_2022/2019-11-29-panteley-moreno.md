second_seminar_abstract: "From the first Internet-based social networking applications designed to get people in contact and make friends, to social networks made up of over 2 billion users, the combination of communication networks, portable devices and AI has changed the way People interact and make decisions. The extent of this influence could be observed not only in marketing, and social behavior but also in referendums and elections, leading to distortion of democratic manifestations and representations. The aim of this presentation is show that an approach based on Systems & Control could be applied to modelling and analisys of the behavior of social networks, as well as, to assess some regulatory policies. The analysis are based on simulation of this models on small and large scale networks."

first_seminar_abstract: "In this talk we present an analysis framework for the study of synchronization of nonlinear systems interconnected over networks described by directed graphs.  Systems may have different dynamical models or the same model with different parameters.  We introduce the concept of dynamic consensus and we characterize the synchronization behavior of the network in terms of the stability properties of two interconnected dynamical systems that evolve in orthogonal spaces: one corresponds to the synchronization error dynamics and the second to the so-called emergent dynamics. Such an approach allows not only to formulate conditions for practical asymptotic synchronization of heterogeneous networked systems, but also to characterize their collective behavior.  In the end we present two extensions of the proposed approach to the analysis of networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators."
