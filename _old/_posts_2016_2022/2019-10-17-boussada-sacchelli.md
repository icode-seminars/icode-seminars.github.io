second_seminar_abstract: "A common strategy in dynamic output feedback stabilization is to apply a state feedback to an observer in order to stabilize the coupled state-observer system. It is well known that global stabilizability, paired with uniform observability, implies semi-global stabilisability by dynamic output feedback. However in many generic cases, the system is not uniformly observable, and usual strategies for semi-global stabilization break down. New approaches need to be explored to resolve this issue. We will present case studies to give an outlook for the challenges raised by this problem and highlight a promising answer based on the idea of unitary embeddings of control systems."

first_seminar_abstract: "For linear delay-differential equations, a question of ongoing interest is to determine conditions on the equation parameters that guarantee exponential stability and stabilization of solutions. This talk starts by a review of an old design method for time-delay systems called ﬁnite pole-placement. Its advantages and limitations shall be stressed. Next, some recent results showing a link between the stable manifold and the manifold corresponding to a given multiplicity of a spectral value shall be presented, hence enabling a spectral abscissa assignment. After a motivation of the tracking of multiple spectral values for analysis/control perspectives, some existing links between Birkhoff’s interpolation problem and a result due to Pólya and Szegö on the number of quasipolynomial's roots in a horizontal strip shall be revisited. Later, hints of an analytic proof of the dominancy of the quasipolynomial's root will be presented, setting up a reduced-complexity delayed stabilizing design. Sensitivity of the control design with respect to the parameters' variation will be discussed. To overcome the sensitivity of multiple roots, an extension of the approach to real distinct pole assignment shall be presented. Finally, various reduced order examples will illustrate the applicative perspectives of the proposed control approach."
