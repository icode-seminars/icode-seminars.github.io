second_seminar_abstract: "In this seminar, I will describe a theoretical framework for learning of nonlinear input-output maps with fading memory by dissipative quantum systems, as a quantum counterpart of the theory of approximating such maps using classical dynamical systems. Such a theory can provide the foundation for harnessing of dissipative quantum systems for applications such as nonlinear systems modelling and signal processing. In particular, the theory identifies the properties required for a class of dissipative quantum systems to be universal, in the sense that any input-output map with fading memory can be approximated arbitrarily closely by an element of this class. We then introduce an example class of dissipative quantum systems that is provably universal. Some numerical examples will be presented.</br>The seminar is based on joint work with J. Chen (Quantum Information Processing, 18(7):198 (2019))  "

first_seminar_abstract: "In this presentation I will consider the approximate controllability problem for the bilinear Schrodinger equation. In particular I will focus on the application of adiabatic techniques in presence of conical eigenvalues intersections of the Hamiltonian operator. These methods allow to design, in a constructive way, control laws capable of (approximately) steering the system from an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian to an arbitrary target state (or, more precisely, to an arbitrary density distribution). The relationship between our results and other controllability results for the bilinear Schrodinger equation will be discussed, as well as the connection between adiabatic and singular perturbation techniques. Finally, in order to justify the applicability of the presented results, I will provide physically meaningful classes of Hamiltonian operators for which eigenvalues intersections are generically conical."
