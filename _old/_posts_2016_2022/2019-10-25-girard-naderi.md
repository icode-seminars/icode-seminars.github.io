second_seminar_abstract: "In this talk, I first present a model order reduction approach for asymptotically stable linear time delay systems with point-wise delays. This approach, which can be regarded as an extension of existing balanced model order reduction techniques for linear delay-free systems, is based on energy functionals that characterize observability and controllability properties of time delay system. This type of approach provides an a priori bound on the reduction error. Moreover, the resulting reduced model is an asymptotically stable time delay system with the same delay-structure as the original model. In the second part of the presentation, I introduce an extended model order reduction technique for time delay systems. This extension is beneficial when the preservation of physical interconnection structures or uncertainties is desired."

first_seminar_abstract: "Autonomous vehicles, intelligent buildings or robots promise to transform the everyday life of our society in all its dimensions (transport, housing, industry, health, assistance to the elderly ...). These systems are examples of cyber-physical systems (CPS) resulting from the integration of computer components and physical processes. The development of these systems is often complex (due to cyber-physical interactions) and with critical safety requirements.</br>In this talk, I will present the first steps towards developing a framework for CPS programming that will enable fast and safe development of their functionality through a high-level programming language. The originality of the approach is to consider that programs are not intended to be executed on the digital platform made up of computer components, but on the cyber-physical platform, which additionally includes the physical part of the system. Thus, high-level programs do not specify the behavior of the computer components but directly that of the cyber-physical system. Then, an automatic synthesis tool uses a model of the physical process to generate low-level control algorithms that enforce the specified behavior.</br>I will introduce a high-level language for CPS directly inspired by the formalism of  hybrid automata. Following the paradigm of 'correct by construction synthesis', low-level control algorithms are synthesized by symbolic control techniques. The key concept of symbolic control is that of the symbolic model, which is a dynamic finite state system, obtained by abstracting physical trajectories on a finite set of symbols. When symbolic and physical dynamics are formally linked by a behavioral relation (e.g., simulation or bisimulation), controllers synthesized for the symbolic model using discrete synthesis techniques can be refined to controllers certified for the physical system. I will provide illustrating examples from the domain of autonomous vehicles."
