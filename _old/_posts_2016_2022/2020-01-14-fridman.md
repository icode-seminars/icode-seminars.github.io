first_seminar_abstract: "The Homogeneous Finite- Time Controllers (HFTC) is proposed to reduce the magnitude of the oscillations caused by the presence of fast-parasitic dynamics in relative degree one systems. The Describing Function (DF) approach is used to predict the amplitude and frequency of fast oscillations. A set of the HFTC gains is suggested to minimize the amplitude of chattering. The analysis of propagation of perturbations is done using the Equivalent Gain (EG) approach showing that due to the integral controller, it is possible to fully compensate constant perturbations. In addition, propagation of harmonic perturbations is computed through standard Transfer Function techniques with the usage of the computed EG.  Simulations and DF-EG predictions allow to conclude that it is possible to improve the accuracy of the output selecting the parameters of the HFTC reasonable. The latter is pending on the velocity of fast parasitic dynamics."
