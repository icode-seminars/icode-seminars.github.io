first_seminar_abstract: "Interconnected autonomous vehicles have the capability toreduce stop-and-go waves propagation and traffic oscillations via the concept of String Stability. To improve the platoon stability, several cases of information sharing are usually considered for each leader-follower interaction, but a common characteristic is that some microscopic variables are always shared among the whole platoon, e.g. the acceleration of the platoon’s leading vehicle or its desired speed profile.</br>This talk investigates the possibility of using macroscopic information to improve control performance of a vehicular platoon composed of autonomous vehicles. A mesoscopic traffic modeling framework is proposed, and closed loop String Stability is achieved by exploiting Input-to-State Stability (ISS) for the analysis of the platoon. Simulations are implemented in order to validate the control laws and to show the efficacy of the proposed approach for mitigating traffic oscillations."
