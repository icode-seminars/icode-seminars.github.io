                    by renewable sources jeopardize the system stability, as testified by the ever-growing \
                    number of frequency incidents. As a remedy, numerous studies demonstrate how virtual \

var abstract031 = 'The use of Lyapunov functions is generally limited to proving the stability of a system \

                    optimal control problems as pointwise nonlinear programmes. These optimisation problems \
                    are equivalent to inverse optimal control problems. This approach is applied to satellite \
                    attitude control. The optimal attitude control problems under consideration will be the \
                    minimisation of the norm of the control torque subject to constraints on the convergence \
                    rate of a Lyapunov function. This approach improves the tradeoff between rapidity and \

var abstract032 = 'This talk deals with the stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense of nonlinear systems \
                    described by retarded functional differential equations. The notion of stabilization in \
                    the sample-and-hold sense has been introduced in 1997 by Clarke, Ledyaev, Sontag and Subbotin, \
                    for nonlinear delay-free systems. Roughly speaking, a state feedback (continuous or not) \
                    is said to be a stabilizer in the sample-and- hold sense if, for any given large ball and \
                    small ball of the origin, there exists a suitable small sampling period such that the \
                    feedback control law obtained by sampling and holding the above state feedback, with \
                    the given sampling period, keeps uniformly bounded all the trajectories starting in any \
                    point of the large ball and, moreover, drives all such trajectories into the small ball, \
                    uniformly in a maximum finite time, keeping them in, thereafter. In this talk suitable \
                    control Lyapunov-Krasovski functionals will be introduced and suitable induced state \
                    feedbacks (continuous or not), and it will be shown that these state feedbacks are \
                    stabilizers in the sample-and- hold sense, for fully nonlinear time-delay systems. \
                    Moreover, in the case of time-delay systems, implementation by means of digital \
                    devices often requires some further approximation due to non availability in the \

                    approximation schemes based on first order splines are used. It is shown, for fully \
                    nonlinear retarded systems, that, by sampling at suitable high frequency the system \
                    (finite dimensional) variable, stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense is still \
                    guaranteed, when the holden input is obtained as a feedback of the (first order) \
                    spline approximation of the (infinite dimensional) system state, whose entries are \
